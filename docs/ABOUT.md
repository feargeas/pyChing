# About pyChing and PancakeBunny

## The Origin Story

In 1999, Stephen M. Gava created pyChing - a Python program for casting and interpreting I Ching hexagrams. It was elegant, functional, and faithful to the ancient tradition.

By 2006, it stopped being maintained. By the 2020s, it no longer worked on modern systems.

## Enter PancakeBunny

PancakeBunny is a persona inspired by [Oolong the rabbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolong_(rabbit)), an early internet meme from 1999-2003. Oolong could balance things on his head - most famously what appeared to be a pancake (actually a dorayaki, a Japanese confection).

The meme's caption: "I have no idea what I'm talking about, so here's a picture of a bunny with a pancake on its head."

This became shorthand for approaching the unknown with honesty and humor rather than false expertise.

## Why PancakeBunny Matters to This Project

PancakeBunny isn't just a mascot. PB represents:

### 1. Beginner's Mind (初心 - Shoshin)
- Approaching with humility rather than assumed expertise
- Learning by doing, despite not knowing the "right" way
- Courage to try even when uncertain

### 2. Cultural Humility
- Acknowledging the limits of Western understanding
- The "pancake" that isn't a pancake (dorayaki)
- The "Book" of Changes that isn't a book as Westerners understand books
- The gap between cultures, honestly acknowledged

### 3. Playful Seriousness
- Using humor to approach profound subjects
- British understatement and irony
- Creating cognitive dissonance deliberately
- Deep respect expressed through light touch

### 4. The Resurrection Mission
- Software as cultural artifact worth preserving
- Learning new skills out of necessity and love
- Community over credential
- Making things accessible despite technical barriers

## Guiding Principles

Based on `project_notes.txt`, which PancakeBunny wrote:

### Cultural Reverence
Preserve the authentic I Ching oracle methodology and traditions. This is a 3000-year-old wisdom tradition deserving of respect.

### Honor the Craft
Maintain and acknowledge Stephen M. Gava's architecture and all contributors. This software has history and that matters.

### Universal Access
Make pyChing accessible across platforms, languages, abilities, and technical contexts. Don't gatekeep wisdom.

## Non-Negotiables

### ✅ MUST PRESERVE:
- Authentic 3-coin oracle algorithm
- James Legge's 1882 translation (exact text)
- Original GPL v2+ license
- Stephen M. Gava's authorship and credit
- All original contributors in CREDITS

### ❌ MUST NOT:
- Change oracle calculation logic without scholarly verification
- Add "features" that disrespect the tradition (gamification, ads, tracking)
- Remove or hide cultural/historical context
- Require internet connection for basic functionality
- Lose the simplicity and focus of the original

## "What Would PancakeBunny Do?"

When facing a decision in this project, ask:

1. **Humility Check**: Am I approaching this with appropriate uncertainty?
2. **Cultural Check**: Am I respecting what I don't fully understand?
3. **Simplicity Check**: Am I keeping it simple and focused?
4. **Access Check**: Am I making this more or less accessible?
5. **Honor Check**: Am I respecting those who came before?

## The Voice

PancakeBunny's voice in documentation is:
- Simple grammar, deep meaning
- Enthusiastic but humble
- Technically sophisticated in content, naive in presentation
- Emotionally and intellectually loaded
- Deliberately creates cognitive dissonance

Some will find this charming. Some will find it irritating. Some will dismiss it as unprofessional.

Those who get it, get it. Those who don't, don't.

*PancakeBunny hope this help understanding. Is simple but not simple. Is silly but not silly. Is like I Ching itself - many layers.*
