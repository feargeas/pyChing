Subject: [PATCH] Fix typos in hexagrams 38 and 47

Fix two typos found during automated extraction and verification:

1. Hexagram 47, line 5774: "goof fortune" → "good fortune"
   This appears to be an OCR error from the original scan.

2. Hexagram 38, line 4732: "THE IMAGE." → "THE IMAGE"
   The extra period is inconsistent with all other hexagrams
   and breaks automated parsing.

Both fixes verified against Wilhelm/Baynes 1950 print edition.
