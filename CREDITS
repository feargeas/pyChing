pyChing - credits
==================

Many thanks to all who have commented on pyChing, sent suggestions and
bug reports and helped in testing. 

In particular, thanks to my wife, for being so great.  8^)

The notes on the hexagrams within pyChing are based on the translation
of the I Ching by James Legge which was published in 1882.

Thanks to Jorgen Schaefer (forcer@debian.org) for originally packaging 
pyching for my personal development platform of choice: Debian GNU/Linux.

Thanks also to Colin Watson of the Debian project for drafting the
original pyching manpage.

Thanks to Markus F.X.J. Oberhumer, the author of PySol (a wonderful
graphical solitaire card program with very many games and features). 
Looking at his code helped me understand how to implement my own much 
more basic hypertext help viewer within pyChing. Give PySol a try,
