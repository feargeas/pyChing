pyChing -- a Python program to cast and interpret I Ching hexagrams
======================================================================

pyChing is a program that allows you to 'consult' the I Ching. The I Ching
is an ancient Chinese book of wisdom, which, apart from being read as a 
book, has also traditionally been consulted as an oracle. pyChing allows 
you to perform an I Ching 'reading' using the coin oracle, and then look 
up a brief interpretation from the I Ching.

pyChing is completely written in Python, a cross platform, object 
oriented, programming language, using the Tkinter oop interface to the 
Tk GUI toolkit.

Highlights:
-----------
  - allows saving/restoring of readings for use within pyChing
  - user configurable colors
  - nifty coin animations
  - readings may also be saved as text, for subsequent printing or whatever
  - information on the hexagrams cast are available within the program
  - hexagram information may be browsed at any time
  - formatted hypertext help and information viewer
  - pyChing should be portable across Linix/Unix/X11, Windows and MacOS/OSX

For installation information consult the file INSTALL.

I'm awaiting your detailed bug reports ;-)

Have fun,
