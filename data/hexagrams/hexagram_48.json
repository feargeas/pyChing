    "judgment": "Looking at Tsing, we think of how the site of a town may be changed, while the fashion of its wells undergoes no changes. The water of a well never disappears and never receives any great increase, and those who come and those who go can draw and enjoy the benefit. If the drawing has nearly been accomplished, but, before the rope has quite reached the water, the bucket is broken, this is evil.",
