When the time of movement which it indicates comes, the subject of the hexagram will be found looking out with apprehension, and yet smiling and talking cheerfully. When the movement like a crash of thunder terrifies all within a hundred miles, they will be like the sincere worshipper who is not startled into letting go their ladle and cup of sacrificial spirits.",
