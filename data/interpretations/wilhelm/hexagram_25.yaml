judgment: 'INNOCENCE. Supreme success.

  Perseverance furthers.

  If someone is not as he should be,

  He has misfortune,

  And it does not further him

  To undertake anything.


  Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him in all

  his movements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he

  attains an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with

  instinctive sureness and without any ulterior thought of reward and

  personal advantage. This instinctive certainty brings about supreme

  success and ''furthers through perseverance". However, not everything

  instinctive is nature in this higher sense of the word, but only that

  which is right and in accord with the will of heaven. Without this

  quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of acting brings

  only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who departs from

  innocence, what does he come to? Heaven''s will and blessing do not go

  with his deeds."'
image: 'Under heaven thunder rolls:

  All things attain the natural state of innocence.

  Thus the kings of old,

  Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,

  Fostered and nourished all beings.


  In springtime when thunder, life energy, begins to move again under the

  heavens, everything sprouts and grows, and all beings receive for the

  creative activity of nature the childlike innocence of their original

  state. So it is with the good rulers of mankind: drawing on the

  spiritual wealth at their command, they take care of all forms of life

  and all forms of culture and do everything to further them, and at the

  proper time.'

      The original impulses of the heart are always good, so that we may

      Nor on the use of the ground while clearing it,

      It furthers one to undertake something.

      We should do every task for its own sake as time and place demand and

      not with an eye to the result. Then each task turns out well, and

      anything we undertake succeeds.'

      The cow that was tethered by someone

      Is the wanderer''s gain, the citizen''s loss.

      Sometimes undeserved misfortune befalls a man at the hands of another,

      as for instance when someone passes by and takes a tethered cow along

      with him. His gain is the owner''s loss. In all transactions, no matter

      how innocent, we must accommodate ourselves to the demands of the time,

      otherwise unexpected misfortune overtakes us.'

    text: 'He who can be persevering

      Remains without blame.

      We cannot lose what really belongs to us, even if we throw it away.

      Therefore we need have no anxiety. All that need concern us is that we

      should remain true to our own natures and not listen to others.'

    text: 'Use no medicine in an illness

      Incurred through no fault of your own.

      It will pass of itself.

      An unexpected evil may come accidentally from without. If it does not

      originate in one''s own nature or have a foothold there, one should not

      resort to external means to eradicate it, but should quietly let nature

      take its course. Then improvement will come of itself.'

    text: 'Innocent action brings misfortune.

      Nothing furthers.

      When, in a given situation, the time is not ripe for further progress,

      the best thing to do is to wait quietly, without ulterior designs. If

      one acts thoughtlessly and tries to push ahead in opposition to fate,

      success will not be achieved.'
