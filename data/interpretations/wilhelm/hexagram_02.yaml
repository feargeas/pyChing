judgment: 'THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,

  Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.

  If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,

  He goes astray;

  But if he follows, he finds guidance.

  It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,

  To forego friends in the east and north.

  Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.


  The four fundamental aspects of the Creative --- "sublime success,

  furthering through perseverance" --- are also attributed to the

  Receptive. Here, however, the perseverance is more closely defined: it

  is that of a mare. The Receptive connotes spatial reality in contrast to

  the spiritual potentiality of the Creative. The potential becomes real

  and the spiritual becomes spatial through a specifically qualifying

  definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here added to the

  idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the dragon

  belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a

  symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen

  because the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with

  the gentleness and devotion of the cow.


  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad

  impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature''s

  richness lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness

  lies in its power to give them beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all

  that lives. It is the Creative that begets things, but they are brought

  to birth by the Receptive. Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the

  hexagram indicated is action in conformity with the situation. The

  person in question is not in an independent position, but is acting as

  an assistant. This means that he must achieve something. It is not his

  task to try to lead --- that would only make him lose the way --- but to

  let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an attitude of

  acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man lets

  himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the

  situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from

  fate.


  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers

  in the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly

  set. The time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for

  west and south symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the

  Creative, as nature does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one

  does not mobilize all one''s powers, the work to be accomplished will

  not be done. Hence to find friends there means to find guidance. But in

  addition to the time of toil and effort, there is also a time of

  planning, and for this we need this solitude. The east symbolized the

  place where a man receives orders from his master, and the north the

  place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he must be

  alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without companions.

  So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional hates

  and favoritism.'
image: 'The earth''s condition is receptive devotion.

  Thus the superior man who has breadth of character

  Carries the outer world.


  Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the

  hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time,

  but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and

  extension in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and

  preserve all things that live and move upon it. The earth in its

  devotion carries all things, good and evil,, without exception. In the

  same way the superior man gives to his character breadth, purity, and

  sustaining power, so that he is able both to support and to bear with

  people and things.'

    text: 'When there is hoarfrost underfoot,

      Solid ice is not far off.

      Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the

      shadowy, represents death. When the first hoarfrost comes in the autumn,

      the power of darkness and cold is just at its beginning. After these

      first warnings, signs of death will gradually multiply, until, in

      obedience to immutable laws, stark winter with its ice is here.

      In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay

      have appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes. But

      in life precautions can be taken by heeding the first signs of decay and

      checking them in time.'

    text: 'Straight, square, great.

      Without purpose,

      Yet nothing remains unfurthered.

      The symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the square.

      Thus squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand,

      movement in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality

      of the Creative. But all square things have their origin in a straight

      line and into turn form solid bodies. In mathematics, when we

      discriminate between lines, planes and solids, we find that rectangular

      planes result from straight lines, and cubic magnitudes from rectangular

      planes. The Receptive accommodates itself to the qualities of the

      Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square develops out of a

      straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with the

      laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added. Therefore

      the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of any

      effort'' yet everything turns out as it should.

      Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It

      tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it

      attains what is right for all without artifice or special intentions.

      Man achieves the height of wisdom when all that he does is as

      self-evident as what nature does.'

      One is able to remain persevering.

      If by chance you are in the service of a king,

      Seek not works, but bring to completion.

      If a man is free of vanity he is able to conceal his abilities and keep

      them from attracting attention too soon; thus he can mature undisturbed.

      If conditions demand it, he can also enter public life, but that too he

      does with restraint. The wise man gladly leaves fame to others. He does

      not seek to have credited to himself things that stand accomplished, but

      hopes to release active forces; that is, he completes his works in such

      a manner that they may bear fruit for the future.'

    text: 'A tied-up sack. No blame, no praise.

      The dark element opens when it moves and closes when at rest. The

      strictest reticence is indicated here. The time is dangerous , because

      any degree of prominence leads either to the enmity of irresistible

      antagonists if one challenges them or to misconceived recognition if one

      is complaisant. Therefore a man ought to maintain reserve, be it in

      solitude or in the turmoil of the world, for there too he can hide

      himself so well that no one knows him.'

    text: 'A yellow lower garment brings supreme good fortune.

      Yellow is the color of the earth and of the middle; it is the symbol of

      that which is reliable and genuine. The lower garment is inconspicuously

      decorated --- the symbol of aristocratic reserve. When anyone is called

      upon to work in a prominent but not independent position, true success

      depends on the utmost discretion. A man''s genuineness and refinement

      should not reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves

      only indirectly as an effect from within.'

    text: 'Dragons fight in the meadow.

      Their blood is black and yellow.

      In the top place the dark element should yield to the light. If it

      attempts to maintain a position to which it is not entitled and to rule

      instead of serving, it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A

      struggle ensues in which it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both

      sides. The dragon, symbol of heaven, comes to fight the false dragon

      that symbolized the inflation of the earth principle. Midnight blue is

      the color of heaven; yellow is the color of earth. Therefore, when black

      and yellow blood flow, it is a sign that in this unnatural contest both

      primal powers suffer injury.'
all_lines_changing: 'When all the lines are sixes, it means:


  Lasting perseverance furthers.


  When nothing but sixes appears, the hexagram of THE RECEPTIVE changes

  into the hexagram of THE CREATIVE(1). By holding fast to what is

  right, it gains the power of enduring. There is indeed no advance, but

  neither is there retrogression.'
