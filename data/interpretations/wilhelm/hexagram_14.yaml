judgment: 'POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.

  Supreme success.


  The two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions

  great measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is it

  possible that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast and

  to possess them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is

  favorable --- a time of strength within, clarity and culture without.

  Power is expressing itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings

  supreme success and wealth.'
image: 'Fire in heaven above:

  The image of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.

  Thus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good,

  And thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.


  The sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one earth, is

  the image of possession on a grand scale. But a possession of this sort

  must be administered properly. The sun brings both evil and good into

  the light of day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor and

  promote the good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will

  of God, who desires only good and not evil.'

    text: 'No relationship with what is harmful;

      There is no blame in this.

      If one remains conscious of difficulty,

      One remains without blame.

      Great possession that is still in its beginnings and that has not yet

      been challenged brings no blame, since there has been no opportunity to

      make mistakes. Yet there are many difficulties to be overcome. It is

      only by remaining conscious of theses difficulties that one can keep

      inwardly free of possible arrogance and wastefulness, and thus in

      principle overcome all cause for blame.'

    text: 'A big wagon for loading.

      One may undertake something.

      No blame.

      Great possession consists not only in the quantity of goods at one''s

      disposal, but first and foremost, in their mobility and utility, for

      then they can be used in undertakings, and we remain free of

      embarrassment and mistakes. The big wagon, which will carry a heavy load

      and in which one can journey farm means that there are at hand able

      helpers who give their support t and are equal to their task. One can

      load great responsibility upon such persons, and this is necessary in

      important undertakings.'

    text: 'A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven.

      A petty man cannot do this.

      A magnanimous, liberal-minded man should not regard what he possesses as

      his exclusive personal property, but should place it at the disposal of

      the ruler or of the people at large. In so doing, he takes the right

      attitude toward his possession, which as private property can never

      endure. A petty man is incapable of this. He is harmed by great

      possessions, because instead of sacrificing them, he would keep them for

      himself.'

    text: 'He makes a difference

      Between himself and his neighbor.

      No blame.

      This characterizes the position of a man placed among rich and powerful

      neighbors. It is a dangerous position. He must look neither to the right

      nor to the left, and must shun envy and the temptation to vie with

      others. In this way he remains free of mistakes.'

    text: 'He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified,

      Has good fortune.

      The situation is very favorable. People are being won not by coercion

      but by unaffected sincerity, so that they are attached to us in

      sincerity and truth. However, benevolence alone is not sufficient at the

      time of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE. For insolence might begin to

      spread. Insolence must be kept in bounds by dignity; then good fortune

      is assured.'

    text: 'He is blessed by heaven.

      Good fortune.

      Nothing that does not further.

      In the fullness of possession and at the height of power, one remains

      modest and gives honor to the sage who stands outside the affairs of the

      world. By this means one puts oneself under the beneficent influence

      descending form heaven, and all goes well. Confucius says of this line:

      To bless means to help. Heaven helps the man who is devoted; men help

      the man who is true. He who walks in truth and is devoted in his

      thinking, and furthermore reveres the worthy, is blessed by heaven. He

      has good fortune, and there is nothing that would not further.'
