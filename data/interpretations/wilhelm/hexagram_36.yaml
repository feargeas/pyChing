judgment: 'DARKENING OF THE LIGHT. In adversity

  It furthers one to be persevering.


  One must not unresistingly let himself be swept along by unfavorable

  circumstances, nor permit his steadfastness to be shaken. He can avoid

  this by maintaining his inner light, while remaining outwardly yielding

  and tractable. With this attitude he can overcome even the greatest

  adversities. In some situations indeed a man must hide his light, in

  order to make his will prevail in spite of difficulties in his immediate

  environment. Perseverance must dwell in inmost consciousness and should

  not be discernible from without. Only thus is a man able to maintain his

  will in the face of difficulties.'
image: 'The light has sunk into the earth:

  The image of DARKENING OF THE LIGHT.

  Thus does the superior man live with the great mass:

  He veils his light, yet still shines.


  In a time of darkness it is essential to be cautious and reserved. One

  should not needlessly awaken overwhelming enmity by inconsiderate

  behavior. In such times one ought not to fall in with the practices of

  others; neither should one drag them censoriously into the light. In

  social intercourse one should not try to be all-knowing. One should let

  many things pass, without being duped.'

    text: 'Darkening of the light during flight.

      He lowers his wings.

      The superior man does not eat for three days

      On his wanderings.

      But he has somewhere to go.

      The host has occasion to gossip about him.

      With grandiose resolve a man endeavors to soar above all obstacles, but

      thus encounters a hostile fate. He retreats and evades the issue. The

      time is difficult. Without rest, he must hurry along, with no permanent

      abiding place. If he does not want to make compromises within himself,

      but insists on remaining true to his principles, he suffers deprivation.

      Nevertheless he has a fixed goal to strive for even though the people

      with whom he lives do not understand him and speak ill of him.'

    text: 'Darkening of the light injures him in the left thigh.

      He gives aid with the strength of a horse.

      Good fortune.

      Here the Lord of Light is in a subordinate place and is wounded by the

      Lord of Darkness. But the injury is not fatal; it is only a hindrance.

      Rescue is still possible. The wounded man gives no thought to himself;

      he thinks only of saving the others who are also in danger. Therefore he

      tries with all his strength to save all that can be saved. There is good

      fortune in thus acting according to duty.'

    text: 'Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south.

      Their great leader is captured.

      One must not expect perseverance too soon.

      It seems as if chance were at work. While the strong, loyal man is

      striving eagerly and in good faith to create order, he meets the

      ringleader of the disorder, as if by accident, and seizes him. Thus

      victory is achieved. But in abolishing abuses one must not be too hasty.

      This would turn out badly because the abuses have been in existence so

      long.'

    text: 'He penetrates the left side of the belly.

      One gets at the very heart of the darkening of the light,

      And leaves gate and courtyard.

      We find ourselves close to the commander of darkness and so discover his

      most secret thoughts. In this way we realize that there is no longer any

      hope of improvement, and thus we are enabled to leave the scene of

      disaster before the storm breaks.'

    text: 'Darkening of the light as with Prince Chi.

      Perseverance furthers.

      Prince Chi lived at the court of the evil tyrant Chou Hsin, who,

      although not mentioned by name, furnished the historical example on

      which this whole situation is based. Prince Chi was a relative of the

      tyrant and could not withdraw from the court; therefore he concealed his

      true sentiments and feigned insanity. Although he was held a slave, he

      did not allow external misery to deflect him from his convictions.

      This provides a teaching for those who cannot leave their posts in times

      of darkness. In order to escape danger, they need invincible

      perseverance of spirit and redoubled caution in their dealings with the

      world.'

    text: 'Not light but darkness.

      First he climbed up to heaven,

      Then plunged into the depths of the earth.

      Here the climax of the darkening is reached. The dark power at first

      held so high a place that it could wound all who were on the side of

      good and of the light. But in the end it perishes of its own darkness,

      for evil must itself fall at the very moment when it has wholly overcome

      the good, and thus consumed the energy to which it owed its duration.'
