judgment: 'LIMITATION. Success.\

  Galling limitation must not be persevered in.


  Limitations are troublesome, but they are effective. If we live

  economically in normal times, we are prepared for times of want. To be

  sparing saves us from humiliation. Limitations are also indispensable in

  the regulation of world conditions. In nature there are fixed limits for

  summer and winter, day and night, and these limits give the year its

  meaning. In the same way, economy, by setting fixed limits upon

  expenditures, acts to preserve property and prevent injury to the

  people.


  But in limitation we must observe due measure. If a man should seek to

  impose galling limitations upon his own nature, it would be injurious.

  And if he should go too far in imposing limitations on others, they

  would rebel. Therefore it is necessary to set limits even upon

  limitation.'
image: 'Water over lake: the image of LIMITATION.\

  Thus the superior man\

  Creates number and measure,\

  And examines the nature of virtue and correct conduct.


  A lake is something limited. Water is inexhaustible. A lake can contain

  only a definite amount of the infinite quantity of water; this is its

  peculiarity. In human life too the individual achieves significance

  through discrimination and the setting of limits. Therefore what

  concerns us here is the problem of clearly defining these

  discriminations, which are, so to speak, the backbone of morality.

  Unlimited possibilities are not suited to man; if they existed, his life

  would only dissolve in the boundless. To become strong, a man\''s life

  needs the limitations ordained by duty and voluntarily accepted. The

  individual attains significance as a free spirit only by surrounding

  himself with these limitations and by determining for himself what his

  duty is.'

    text: 'Not going out of the door and the courtyard\

      Is without blame.

      Often a man who would like to undertake something finds himself

      confronted by insurmountable limitations. Then he must know where to

      stop. If he rightly understands this and does not go beyond the limits

      set for him, he accumulates an energy that enables him, when the proper

      time comes, to act with great force. Discretion is of prime importance

      in preparing the way for momentous things. Concerning this, Confucius

      says:

      Where disorder develops, words are the first steps. If the prince is not

      discreet, he loses his servant. If the servant is not discreet he loses

      his life. If germinating things are not handled with discretion, the

      perfecting of them is impeded. Therefore the superior man is careful to

      maintain silence and does not go forth.'

    text: 'Not going out of the gate and the courtyard\

      Brings misfortune.

      When the time for action has come, the moment must be quickly seized.

      Just as water first collects in a lake without flowing out, yet is

      certain to find an outlet when the lake is full, so it is in the life of

      man. It is a good thing to hesitate so long as the time for action has

      not come, but no longer. Once the obstacles to action have been removed,

      anxious hesitation is a mistake that is bound to bring disaster, because

      one misses one\''s opportunity.'

    text: 'He who knows no limitation\

      Will have cause to lament.\

      No blame.

      If an individual is bent only on pleasures and enjoyment, it is easy for

      him to lose his sense of the limits that are necessary. If he gives

      himself over to extravagance, he will have to suffer the consequences,

      with accompanying regret. He must not seek to lay the blame on others.

      Only when we realize that our mistakes are of our own making will such

      disagreeable experiences free us of errors.'

    text: 'Contented limitation. Success.

      Every limitation has its value, but a limitation that requires

      persistent effort entails a cost of too much energy. When, however, the

      limitation is a natural one (as for example, the limitation by which

      water flows only downhill), it necessarily leads to success, for then it

      means a saving of energy. The energy that otherwise would be consumed in

      a vain struggle with the object, is applied wholly to the benefit of the

      matter in hand, and success is assured.'

    text: 'Sweet limitation brings good fortune.\

      Going brings esteem.

      The limitation must be carried out in the right way if it is to be

      effective. If we seek to impose restrictions on others only, while

      evading them ourselves, these restrictions will always be resented and

      will provoke resistance. If, however, a man in a leading position

      applies the limitation first to himself, demanding little from those

      associated with him, and with modest means manages to achieve something,

      good fortune is the result. Where such an example occurs, it meets with

      emulation, so that whatever is undertaken must succeed.'

    text: 'Galling limitation.\

      Perseverance brings misfortune.\

      Remorse disappears.

      If one is too severe in setting up restrictions, people will not endure

      them. The more consistent such severity, the worse it is, for in the

      long run a reaction is unavoidable. In the same way, the tormented body

      will rebel against excessive asceticism. On the other hand, although

      ruthless severity is not to be applied persistently and systematically,

      there may be times when it is the only means of safeguarding against

      guilt and remorse. In such situations ruthlessness toward oneself is the

      only means of saving one\''s soul, which otherwise would succumb to

      irresolution and temptation.'
