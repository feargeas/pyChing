judgment: 'ABUNDANCE has success.\

  The king attains abundance.\

  Be not sad.\

  Be like the sun at midday.


  It is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of outstanding

  greatness and abundance. Only a born ruler of men is able to do it,

  because his will is directed to what is great. Such a time of abundance

  is usually brief. Therefore a sage might well feel sad in view of the

  decline that must follow. But such sadness foes not befit him. Only a

  man who is inwardly free of sorrow and care can lead in a time of

  abundance. He must be like the sun at midday, illuminating and

  gladdening everything under heaven.'
image: 'Both thunder and lightning come:\

  The image of ABUNDANCE.\

  Thus the superior man decides lawsuits\

  And carries out punishments.


  This hexagram has a certain connection with Shih Ho, BITING THROUGH

  ([21](#21)), in which thunder and lightning similarly appear together,

  but in the reverse order. In BITING THROUGH, laws are laid down; here

  they are applied and enforced. Clarity \[Li\] within makes it possible

  to investigate the facts exactly, and shock \[Chên\] without ensures a

  strict and precise carrying out of punishments.'

    text: 'When a man meets his destined ruler,\

      They can be together ten days,\

      And it is not a mistake.\

      Going meets with recognition.

      To bring about a time of abundance, a union of clarity with energetic

      movement is needed. Two individuals possessed of these two attributes

      are suited to each other, and even if they spend an entire cycle of time

      together during the period of abundance, it will not be too long, nor is

      it a mistake. Therefore one may go forth, in order to make one\''s

      influence felt; it will meet with recognition.'

    text: 'The curtain is of such fullness\

      That the polestars can be seen at noon.\

      Through going one meets with mistrust and hate.\

      If one rouses him through truth,\

      Good fortune comes.

      It often happens that plots and party intrigues, which have the

      darkening effect of an eclipse of the sun, come between a ruler intent

      on great achievement and the man who could effect great undertakings.

      Then, instead of the sun, we see the northern stars in the sky. The

      ruler is overshadowed by a party that has usurped power. If a man at

      such a time were to try to take energetic measures, he would encounter

      only mistrust and envy, which would prohibit all movement. The essential

      thing then is to hold inwardly to the power of truth, which in the end

      is so strong that it exerts an invisible influence on the ruler, so that

      all goes well.'

    text: 'The underbrush is of such abundance\

      That the small stars can be seen at noon.\

      He breaks his right arm. No blame.

      The image is that of a progressive covering over of the sun. Here the

      eclipse reaches totality, therefore even the small stars can be seen at

      noon.

      In the sphere of social relationships, this means that the prince is now

      so eclipsed that even the most insignificant persons can push themselves

      into the foreground. This makes it impossible for an able man, though he

      might be the right hand of the ruler, to undertake anything. It is as

      though his arm were broken, but he is not to blame for being thus

      hindered in action.'

    text: 'The curtain is of such fullness\

      That the polestars can be seen at noon.\

      He meets his ruler, who is of like kind.\

      Good fortune.

      Here the darkness is already decreasing, therefore interrelated elements

      come together. Here too the complement must be found --- the necessary

      wisdom to complement joy of action. Then everything will go well. The

      complementary factor postulated here is the reverse of the one in the

      first line. In the latter, wisdom is to be complemented by energy, while

      here energy is complemented by wisdom.'

    text: 'Lines are coming,\

      Blessing and fame draw near.\

      Good fortune.

      The ruler is modest and therefore open to the counsel of able men. Thus

      he is surrounded by men who suggest to him the lines of action. This

      brings blessing, fame, and good fortune to him and all the people.'

    text: 'His house is in a state of abundance.\

      He screens off his family.\

      He peers through the gate\

      And no longer perceives anyone.\

      For three years he sees nothing.\

      Misfortune.

      This describes a man who because of his arrogance and obstinacy attains

      the opposite of what he strives for. He seeks abundance and splendor for

      his dwelling. He wishes at all odds to be master in his house, which so

      alienates his family that in the end he finds himself completely

      isolated.'
