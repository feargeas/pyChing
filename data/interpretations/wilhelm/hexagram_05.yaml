judgment: 'WAITING. If you are sincere,\

  You have light and success.\

  Perseverance brings good fortune.\

  It furthers one to cross the great water.


  Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching

  the goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success.

  This leads to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows

  power to cross the great water.


  One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness and

  impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate,

  for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength

  shows itself in uncompromising truthfulness \[with himself\]. It is only

  when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any

  sort of self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of

  events, by which the path to success may be recognized. This recognition

  must be followed by resolute and persevering action. For only the man

  who goes to meet his fate resolutely is equipped to deal with it

  adequately. Then he will be able to cross the great water --- that is to

  say, he will be capable of making the necessary decision and of

  surmounting the danger.'
image: 'Clouds rise up to heaven:\

  The image of WAITING.\

  Thus the superior man eats and drinks,\

  Is joyous and of good cheer.


  When clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will rain. There is

  nothing to do but to wait until after the rain falls. It is the same in

  life when destiny is at work. We should not worry and seek to shape the

  future by interfering in things before the time is ripe. We should

  quietly fortify the body with food and drink and the mind with gladness

  and good cheer. Fate comes when it will, and thus we are ready.'

    text: 'Waiting in the meadow.\

      It furthers one to abide in what endures.\

      No blame.

      The danger is not yet close. One is still waiting on the open plain.

      Conditions are still simple, yet there is a feeling of something

      impending. One must continue to lead a regular life as long as possible.

      Only in this way does one guard against a premature waste of strength,

      keep free of blame and error that would become a source of weakness

      later on.'

    text: 'Waiting on the sand.\

      There is some gossip.\

      The end brings good fortune.

      The danger gradually comes closer. Sand is near the bank of the river,

      and the water means danger. Disagreements crop up. General unrest can

      easily develop in such times, and we lay the blame on one another. He

      who stays calm will succeed in making things go well in the end. Slander

      will be silenced if we do not gratify it with injured retorts.'

    text: 'Waiting in the mud\

      Brings about the arrival of the enemy.

      Mud is no place for waiting, since it is already being washed by the

      water of the stream. Instead of having gathered strength to cross the

      stream at one try, one has made a premature start that has got him no

      farther than the muddy bank. Such an unfavorable position invites

      enemies from without, who naturally take advantage of it. Caution and a

      sense of the seriousness of the situation are all that can keep one from

      injury.'

    text: 'Waiting in blood.\

      Get out of the pit.

      The situation is extremely dangerous. IT is of utmost gravity now --- a

      matter of life and death. Bloodshed seems imminent. There is no going

      forward or backward; we are cut off as if in a pit. Now we must simply

      stand fast and let fate take its course. This composure, which keeps us

      from aggravating the trouble by anything we might do, is the only way of

      getting out of the dangerous pit.'

    text: 'Waiting at meat and drink.\

      Perseverance brings good fortune.

      Even in the midst of danger there come intervals of peace when things go

      relatively well. If we possess enough inner strength, we shall take

      advantage of these intervals to fortify ourselves for renewed struggle.

      We must know how to enjoy the moment without being deflected from the

      goal, for perseverance is needed to remain victorious.

      This is true in public life as well; it is not possible to achieve

      everything all at once. The height of wisdom is to allow people enough

      recreation to quicken pleasure in their work until the task is

      completed. Herein lies the secret of the whole hexagram. It differs from

      Chin OBSTRUCTION (39), in the fact that in this instance, while

      waiting, we are sure of our cause and therefore do not lose the serenity

      born of inner cheerfulness.'

    text: 'One falls into the pit.\

      Three uninvited guests arrive.\

      Honor them, and in the end there will be good fortune.

      The waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted. One falls into

      the pit and must yield to the inevitable. Everything seems to have been

      in vain. But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn.

      Without a move on one\''s own part, there is outside intervention. At

      first one cannot be sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it

      destruction? A person in this situation must keep his mind alert and not

      withdraw into himself with a sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet

      the new turn with respect. Thus he ultimately escapes the danger, and

      all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune often come in a form that at

      first seems strange to us.'
