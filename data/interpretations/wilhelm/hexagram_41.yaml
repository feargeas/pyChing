judgment: 'DECREASE combined with sincerity

  Brings about supreme good fortune

  Without blame.

  One may be persevering in this.

  It furthers one to undertake something.

  How is this to be carried out?

  One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.


  Decrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad. Increase

  and decrease come in their own time. What matters here is to understand

  the time and not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense. If a

  time of scanty resources brings out an inner truth, one must not feel

  ashamed of simplicity. For simplicity is then the very thing needed to

  provide inner strength for further undertakings. Indeed, there need be

  no concern if the outward beauty of the civilization, even the

  elaboration of religious forms, should have to suffer because of

  simplicity. One must draw on the strength of the inner attitude to

  compensate for what is lacking in externals; then the power of the

  content makes up for the simplicity of form. There is no need of

  presenting false appearances to God. Even with slender means, the

  sentiment of the heart can be expressed.'
image: 'At the foot of the mountain, the lake:

  The image of DECREASE.

  Thus the superior man controls his anger

  And restrains his instincts.


  The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it

  decreases to the benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its

  moisture. The mountain stands as the symbol of stubborn strength that

  can harden into anger. The lake is the symbol of unchecked gaiety that

  can develop into passionate drives at the expense of the life forces.

  Therefore decrease is necessary; anger must be decreased by keeping

  still, the instincts must be curbed by restriction. By this decrease of

  the lower powers of the psyche, the higher aspects of the soul are

  enriched.'

    text: 'Going quickly when one''s tasks are finished

      Is without blame.

      But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.

      It is unselfish and good when a man, after completing his own urgent

      tasks, uses his strength in the service of others, and without bragging

      or making much of it, helps quickly where help is needed. But the man in

      a superior position who is thus aided must weigh carefully how much he

      can accept without doing the helpful servant or friend real harm. Only

      where such delicacy of feeling exists can one give oneself

      unconditionally and without hesitation.'

    text: 'Perseverance furthers.

      To undertake something brings misfortune.

      Without decreasing oneself,

      One is able to bring increase to others.

      A high-minded self-awareness and a consistent seriousness with no

      forfeit of dignity are necessary if a man wants to be of service to

      others. He who throws himself away in order to do the bidding of a

      superior diminishes his own position without thereby giving lasting

      benefit to the other. This is wrong. To render true service of lasting

      value to another, one must serve him without relinquishing oneself.'

    text: 'When three people journey together,

      Their number increases by one.

      When one man journeys alone,

      He finds a companion.

      When there are three people together, jealousy arises. One of them will

      have to go. Avery close bond is possible only between two people. But

      when one man is lonely, he is certain to find a companion who

      complements him.'

    text: 'If a man deceases his faults,

      It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.

      No blame.

      A man''s faults often prevent even well-disposed people from coming

      closer to him. His faults are sometimes reinforced by the environment in

      which he lives. But if in humility he can bring himself to the point of

      giving them up, he frees his well-disposed friends from an inner

      pressure and causes them to approach the more quickly, and there is

      mutual joy.'

      Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.

      Supreme good fortune.

      If someone is marked out by fate for good fortune, it comes without

      fail. All oracles --- as for instance those that are read from the

      shells of tortoises --- are bound to concur in giving him favorable

      signs. He need fear nothing, because his luck is ordained from on high.'

    text: 'If one is increased without depriving other,

      There is no blame.

      Perseverance brings good fortune.

      It furthers one to undertake something.

      One obtains servants

      But no longer has a separate home.

      There are people who dispense blessings to the whole world. Every

      increase in power that comes to them benefits the whole of mankind and

      therefore does not bring decrease to others. Through perseverance and

      zealous work a man wins success and finds helpers as they are needed.

      But what he accomplishes is not a limited private advantage; it is a

      public good and available to everyone.'
