judgment: 'PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.\

  The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.\

  It furthers one to have somewhere to go.\

  Success.


  The weight of the great is excessive. The load is too heavy for the

  strength of the supports. The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests,

  sags to the breaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for

  the load they bear. It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore

  extraordinary measures are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of

  transition as quickly as possible, and to take action. This promises

  success. For although the strong element is in excess, it is in the

  middle, that is, at the center of gravity, so that a revolution is not

  to be feared. Nothing is to be achieved by forcible measures. The

  problem must be solved by gently penetration to the meaning of the

  situation (as is suggested by the attribute of the inner trigram, Sun);

  then the change-over to other conditions will be successful. It demands

  real superiority; therefore the time when the great preponderates is a

  momentous time.'
image: 'The lake rises above the trees:\

  The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.\

  Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,\

  Is unconcerned,\

  And if he has to renounce the world,\

  He is undaunted.


  Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times

  when the lake rises over the treetops. But such conditions are

  temporary. The two trigrams indicate the attitude proper to such

  exceptional times: the symbol of the trigram Sun is the tree, which

  stands firm even though it stands alone, and the attribute of Tui is

  joyousness, which remains undaunted even if it must renounce the world.'

    text: 'To spread white rushes underneath.\

      No blame.

      When a man wishes to undertake an enterprise in extraordinary times, he

      must be extraordinarily cautious, just as when setting a heavy thing

      down on the floor, one takes care to put rushes under it, so that

      nothing will break. This caution, though it may seem exaggerated, is not

      a mistake. Exceptional enterprises cannot succeed unless utmost caution

      is observed in their beginnings and in the laying of their foundations.'

    text: 'A dry poplar sprouts at the root.\

      An older man takes a young wife.\

      Everything furthers.

      Wood is near water; hence the image of an old poplar sprouting at the

      root. This means an extraordinary situation arises when an older man

      marries a young girl who suits him. Despite the unusualness of the

      situation, all goes well. From the point of view of politics, the

      meaning is that in exceptional times one does well to join with the

      lowly, for this affords a possibility of renewal.'

    text: 'The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.\

      Misfortune.

      This indicates a type of man who in times of preponderance of the great

      insists on pushing ahead. He accepts no advice from others, and

      therefore they in turn are not willing to lend him support. Because of

      this the burden grows, until the structure of things bends or breaks.

      Plunging willfully ahead in times of danger only hastens the

      catastrophe.'

    text: 'The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune.\

      If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating.

      Through friendly relations with people of lower rank, a responsible man

      succeeds in becoming master of the situation. But if, instead of working

      for the rescue of the whole, he were to misuse his connections to obtain

      personal power and success, it would lead to humiliation.'

    text: 'A withered poplar puts forth flowers.\

      An older woman takes a husband.\

      No blame. No praise.

      A withered poplar that flowers exhausts its energies thereby and only

      hastens its end. An older woman may marry once more, but no renewal

      takes place. Everything remains barren. Thus, though all the amenities

      are observed, the net result is only the anomaly of the situation.

      Applied to politics, the metaphor means that if in times of insecurity

      we give up alliance with those below us and keep up only the

      relationships we have with people of higher rank, an unstable situation

      is created.'

    text: 'One must go through the water.\

      It goes over one\''s head.\

      Misfortune. No blame.

      Here is a situation in which the unusual has reached a climax. One is

      courageous and wishes to accomplish one\''s task, no matter what happens.

      This leads into danger. The water rises over one\''s head. This is the

      misfortune. But one incurs no blame in giving up one\''s life that the

      good and the right may prevail. There are things that are more important

      than life.'
