judgment: 'THE ARMY. The army needs perseverance\

  And a strong man.\

  Good fortune without blame.


  An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting

  force. Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this

  discipline must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who

  captures the hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order

  that he may develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of

  his ruler, who must entrust him with full responsibility as long as the

  war lasts. But war is always a dangerous thing and brings with it

  destruction and devastation. Therefore it should not be resorted to

  rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used as a last recourse.


  The justifying cause of a war, and clear and intelligible war aims,

  ought to be explained to the people by an experienced leader. Unless

  there is a quite definite war aim to which the people can consciously

  pledge themselves, the unity and strength of conviction that lead to

  victory will not be forthcoming. But the leader must also look to it

  that the passion of war and the delirium of victory do not give rise to

  unjust acts that will not meet with general approval. If justice and

  perseverance are the basis of action, all goes well.'

  The image of THE ARMY.\

  Thus the superior man increases his masses\

  By generosity toward the people.


  Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way the

  military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When

  danger threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When

  danger threatens, every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he

  goes back to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their

  love, and a people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful.

  Only a people economically strong can be important in military power.

  Such power must therefore be cultivated by improving the economic

  condition of the people and by humane government. Only when there is

  this invisible bond between government and people, so that the people

  are sheltered by their government as ground water is sheltered by the

  earth, is it possible to wage a victorious war.'

    text: 'An army must set forth in proper order.\

      If the order is not good, misfortune threatens.

      At the beginning of a military enterprise, order is imperative. A just

      and valid cause must exist, and the obedience and coordination of the

      troops must be well organized, otherwise the result is inevitably

      failure.'

    text: 'In the midst of the army.\

      Good fortune. No blame.\

      The king bestows a triple decoration.

      The leader should be in the midst of his army, in touch with it, sharing

      good and bad with the masses he leads. This alone makes him equal to the

      heavy demands made upon him. He needs also the recognition of the ruler.

      The decorations he receives are justified, because there is no question

      of personal preferment here: the whole army, whose center he is, is

      honored in his person.'

    text: 'Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon.\

      Misfortune.

      Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because

      someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the

      other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, \"carries

      corpses in the wagon,\" is interpreted differently. At burials and at

      sacrifices to the dead it was customary in China for the deceased to

      whom the sacrifice was made to be represented by a boy of the family,

      who sat in the dead man\''s place and was honored as his representative.

      On the basis of this custom the text is interpreted as meaning that a

      \"corpse boy\" is sitting in the wagon, or, in other words, that

      authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has been

      usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is

      inferred that there has been an error in copying. The character fan,

      meaning \"all,\" may have been misread as shih, which means \"corpse.\"

      Allowing for this error, the meaning would be that if the multitude

      assumes leadership of the army (rides in the wagon), misfortune will

      ensue.'

    text: 'The army retreats. No blame.

      In the face of a superior enemy, with whom it would be hopeless to

      engage in battle, an orderly retreat is the only correct procedure,

      because it will save the army from defeat and disintegration. It is by

      no means a sign of courage or strength to insist upon engaging in a

      hopeless struggle regardless of circumstances.'

    text: 'There is game in the field.\

      It furthers one to catch it.\

      Without blame.\

      Let the eldest lead the army.\

      The younger transports corpses;\

      Then perseverance brings misfortune.

      Game is in the field --- it has left its usual haunts in the forest and

      is devastating the fields. This points to an enemy invasion. Energetic

      combat and punishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not

      degenerate into a wild melee in which everyone fends for himself.

      Despite the greatest degree of perseverance and bravery, this would lead

      to misfortune. The army must be directed by an experienced leader. It is

      a matter of waging war, not of permitting the mob to slaughter all who

      fall into their hands; if they do, defeat will be the result, and

      despite all perseverance there is danger of misfortune.'

    text: 'The great prince issues commands,\

      Founds states, vests families with fiefs.\

      Inferior people should not be employed.

      The war has ended successfully, victory is won, and the king divided

      estates and fiefs among his faithful vassals. But it is important that

      inferior people should not come into power. If they have helped, let

      them be paid off with money, but they should not be awarded lands or the

      privileges of rulers, lest power be abused.'
