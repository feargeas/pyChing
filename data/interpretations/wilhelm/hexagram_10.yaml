judgment: 'TREADING. Treading upon the tail of the tiger.\

  It does not bite the man. Success.


  The situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that

  which is weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong

  and worries it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the

  weak, because the contact is in good humor and harmless.


  In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, intractable people.

  In such a case one\''s purpose will be achieved if one behaves with

  decorum. Pleasant manners succeed even with irritable people.'
image: 'Heaven above, the lake below:\

  The image of TREADING.\

  Thus the superior man discriminates between high and low,\

  And thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.


  Heaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in the

  natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there are

  necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible to bring about

  universal equality. But it is important that differences in social rank

  should not be arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class

  struggle are the inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand,

  external differences in rank correspond with differences in inner worth,

  and if inner worth forms the criterion of external rank, people

  acquiesce and order reigns in society.'

    text: 'Simple conduct. Progress without blame.

      The situation is one in which we are still not bound by any obligations

      of social intercourse. If our conduct is simple, we remain free of them

      We can quietly follow our predilections as long as we are content and

      make not demands on people.

      The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but progress. A man finds

      himself in an altogether inferior position at the start. However, he has

      the inner strength that guarantees progress. If he can be content with

      simplicity, he can make progress without blame. When a man is

      dissatisfied with modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and

      tries to advance, not for the sake of accomplishing anything worth

      while, but merely in order to escape from lowliness and poverty by dint

      of his conduct. Once his purpose is achieved, he is certain to become

      arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore blame attaches to his progress. On

      the other hand, a man who is good at his work is content to behave

      simply. He wishes to make progress in order to accomplish something.

      When he attains his goal, he does something worth while, an all is well.'

    text: 'Treading a smooth, level course.\

      The perseverance of a dark man\

      Brings good fortune.

      The situation of a lonely sage is indicated here. He remains withdrawn

      from the bustle of life, seeks nothing, asks nothing of anyone, and

      travels through life unassailed, on a level road. Since he is content

      and does not challenge fate, he remains free of entanglements.'

    text: 'A one-eyed man is able to see,\

      A lame man is able to tread.\

      He treads on the tail of the tiger.\

      The tiger bites the man.\

      Misfortune.

      Thus does a warrior act on behalf of his great prince.

      A one-eyed man can indeed see, but not enough for clear vision. A lame

      man can indeed treat, but not enough to make progress. If in spite of

      such defects a man considers himself strong and consequently exposes

      himself to danger, he is inviting disaster, for he is undertaking

      something beyond his strength. This reckless way of plunging ahead,

      regardless of the adequacy of one\''s powers, can be justified only in

      the case of a warrior battling for his prince.'

    text: 'He treads on the tail of the tiger.\

      Caution and circumspection\

      Lead ultimately to good fortune.

      This text refers to a dangerous enterprise. The inner power to carry it

      through is there, but this inner power is combined with hesitating

      caution in one\''s external attitude. This line contrasts with the

      preceding line, which is weak within but outwardly presses forward. Here

      one is sure of ultimate success, which consists in achieving one\''s

      purpose, that is, in overcoming danger by going forward.'

    text: 'Resolute conduct.\

      Perseverance with awareness of danger.

      This refers to the ruler of the hexagram as a whole. One sees that one

      has to be resolute in conduct. But at the same time one must remain

      conscious of the danger connected with such resoluteness, especially if

      it is to be persevered in. Only awareness of the danger makes success

      possible.'

    text: 'Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs.\

      When everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes.

      The work is ended. If we want to know whether good fortune will follow,

      we must look back upon our conduct and its consequences. If the effects

      are good, then good fortune is certain. No one knows himself. It is only

      by the consequences of his actions, by the fruit of his labors, that a

      man can judge what he is to expect.'
