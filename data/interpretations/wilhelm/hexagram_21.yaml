judgment: 'BITING THROUGH has success.

  It is favorable to let justice be administered.


  When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings

  success. This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be

  established, the obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is

  interfering and blocking the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous

  measures must be taken at once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does

  not vanish of its own accord. Judgment and punishment are required to

  deter or obviate it.


  However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram

  combines Li, clarity, and Chên, excitement. Li is yielding, Chên is

  hard. Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting

  out punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak.

  The two together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man

  who makes the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by

  nature, while he commands respect by his conduct in his position.'
image: 'Thunder and lighting:

  The image of BITING THROUGH.

  Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws

  Through clearly defined penalties.


  Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The laws specify

  the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severe penalties are

  differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes. This is

  symbolized by the clarity of lighting. The law is strengthened by a just

  application of penalties. This is symbolized by the terror of thunder.

  This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling respect; it is

  not that the penalties are ends in themselves. The obstructions in the

  social life of man increase when there is alack of clarity in the penal

  codes and slackness in executing them. The only to strengthen the law is

  to make it clear and make penalties certain and swift.'

    text: 'His feet are fastened in the stocks,

      So that his toes disappear.

      No blame.

      If a sentence is imposed the first time a man attempts to do wrong, the

      penalty is a mild one. Only the toes are put in the stocks. This

      prevents him from sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame. It

      is a warning to halt in time on the path of evil.'

    text: 'Bites through tender meat,

      So that his nose disappears.

      No blame.

      It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case; it is

      like biting through tender meat. But one encounters a hardened sinner,

      and, aroused by anger, one goes a little too far. The disappearance of

      the nose in the course of the bite signifies that indignation blots out

      finer sensibility. However, there is no great harm in this, because the

      penalty as such is just.'

    text: 'Bites on old dried meat

      And strikes on something poisonous.

      Slight humiliation. No blame.

      Punishment is to be carried out by someone who lacks the power and

      authority to do so. Therefore the culprits do not submit. The matter at

      issue is an old one --- as symbolized by salted game --- and in dealing

      with it difficulties arise. This old meat is spoiled: by taking up the

      problem the punisher arouses poisonous hatred against himself, and n

      this way is put in a somewhat humiliating position. But since punishment

      was required by the time, he remains free of blame.'

    text: 'Bites on dried gristly meat.

      Receives metal arrows.

      It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties

      And to be persevering.

      Good fortune.

      There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to be

      punished. Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds. But it is

      necessary to be hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the

      difficulties. If one knows these difficulties and remains persevering,

      he attains good fortune. The difficult task is achieved in the end.'

    text: 'Bites on dried lean meat.

      Receives yellow gold.

      Perseveringly aware of danger.

      No blame.

      The case to be decided is indeed not easy but perfectly clear. Since we

      naturally incline to leniency, we must make every effort to be like

      yellow gold --- that is, as true as gold and as impartial as yellow, the

      color of the middle [the mean]. It is only by remaining conscious of

      the dangers growing out of the responsibility we have assumed that we

      can avoid making mistakes.'

    text: 'His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,

      So that his ears disappear.

      Misfortune.

      In contrast to the first line, this line refers to a man who is

      incorrigible. His punishment is the wooden cangue, and his ears

      disappear under it --- that is to say, he is deaf to warnings. This

      obstinacy leads to misfortune.

      It should be noted here that there is an alternative interpretation of

      this hexagram, based on the idea, "Above, light (the sun); below,

      movement." In this interpretation the hexagram symbolizes a market

      below, full of movement, while the sun is shining in the sky above. The

      allusion to meat suggests that it is a food market. Gold and arrows are

      articles of trade. The disappearance of the nose means the vanishing of

      smell, that is, the person in question is not covetous. The idea of

      poison points to the dangers of wealth, and so on throughout.

      Confucius says in regard to the nine at the beginning in this hexagram:

      "The inferior man is not ashamed of unkindness and does not shrink from

      injustice. If no advantage beckons he makes no effort. If he is not

      intimidated he does not improve himself, but if he is made to behave

      correctly in small matters he is careful in large ones. This is

      fortunate for the inferior man."

      On the subject of the nine at the top Confucius says: "If good does not

      accumulate, it is not enough to make a name for a man. If evil does not

      accumulate, it is not strong enough to destroy a man. Therefore the

      inferior man thinks to himself, ''Goodness in small things has no

      value,'' and so neglects it. He thinks, ''Small sins do no harm,'' and

      so does not give them up. Thus his sins accumulate until they can no

      longer be covered up, and his guilt becomes so great that it can no

      longer be wiped out."'
