judgment: 'OPPOSITION. In small matters, good fortune.


  When people live in opposition and estrangement they cannot carry out a

  great undertaking in common; their points of view diverge too widely. In

  such circumstances one should above all not proceed brusquely, for that

  would only increase the existing opposition; instead, one should limit

  oneself to producing gradual effects in small matters. Here success can

  still be expected, because the situation is such that the opposition

  does not preclude all agreement.


  In general, opposition appears as an obstruction, but when it represents

  polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful and

  important functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth, spirit and

  nature, man and woman, when reconciled, bring about the creation and

  reproduction of life. In the world of visible things, the principle of

  opposites makes possible the differentiation by categories through which

  order is brought into the world.


  THE IMAGE.


  Above, fire; below. The lake.\

  The image of OPPOSITION.\

  Thus amid all fellowship\

  The superior man retains his individuality.


  The two elements, fire and water, never mingle but even when in contact

  retain their own natures. So the cultured man is never led into baseness

  or vulgarity through intercourse or community of interests with persons

  of another sort; regardless of all commingling, he will always preserve

  his individuality.'

    text: 'Remorse disappears.\

      If you lose your horse, do not run after it;\

      It will come back of its own accord.\

      When you see evil people,\

      Guard yourself against mistakes.

      Even in times when oppositions prevail, mistakes can be avoided, so that

      remorse disappears. When opposition begins to manifest itself, a man

      must not try to bring about unity by force, for by so doing he would

      only achieve the contrary, just as a horse goes farther and farther away

      if one runs after it. If it is one\''s own horse, one can safely let it

      go; it will come back of its own accord. So too when someone who belongs

      with us is momentarily estranged because of a misunderstanding, he will

      return of his own accord if we leave matters to him. One the other hand,

      it is well to be cautious when evil men who do not belong with us force

      themselves upon us, again as the result of a misunderstanding. Here the

      important thing is to avoid mistakes. We must not try to shake off these

      evil men by force; this would give rise to real hostility. We must

      simply endure them. They will eventually withdraw of their own accord.'

    text: 'One meets his lord in a narrow street.\

      No blame.

      As a result of misunderstandings, it has become impossible for people

      who by nature belong together to meet in the correct way. This being so,

      an accidental meeting under informal circumstances may serve the

      purpose, provided there is an inner affinity between them.'

    text: 'One sees the wagon dragged back,\

      The oxen halted,\

      A man\''s hair and nose cut off.\

      Not a good beginning, but a good end.

      Often it seems to a man as though everything were conspiring against

      him. He sees himself checked and hindered in his progress, insulted and

      dishonored. However, he must not let himself be misled; despite this

      opposition, he must cleave to the man with whom he knows he belongs.

      Thus, notwithstanding the bad beginning, the matter will end well.'

    text: 'Isolated through opposition,\

      One meets a like-minded man\

      With whom one can associate in good faith.\

      Despite the danger, no blame.

      If a man finds himself in a company of people from whom he is separated

      by an inner opposition, he becomes isolated. But if in such a situation

      a man meets someone who fundamentally by the very law of his being, is

      kin to him, and whom he can trust completely, he overcomes all the

      dangers of isolation. His will achieves its aim, and he becomes free of

      faults.'

      The companion bites his way through the wrappings.\

      If one goes to him,\

      How could it be a mistake?

      Coming upon a sincere man, one fails to recognize him at first because

      of the general estrangement. However, he bites his way through the

      wrappings that are causing the separation. When such a companion thus

      reveals himself in his true character, it is one\''s duty to go to meet

      him and to work with him.'

    text: 'Isolated through opposition,\

      One sees one\''s companion as a pig covered with dirt,\

      As a wagon full of devils.\

      First one draws a bow against him,\

      Then one lays the bow aside.\

      He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time.\

      As one goes, rain falls; then good fortune comes.

      Here the isolation is due to misunderstanding; it is brought about not

      by outer circumstances but by inner conditions. A man misjudges his best

      friends, taking them to be as unclean as a dirty pig in and as dangerous

      as a wagon full of devils. He adopts an attitude of defense. But in the

      end, realizing his mistake, he lays aside the bow, perceiving that the

      other is approaching with the best intentions for the purpose of close

      union. Thus the tension is relieved. The union resolves the tension,

      just as falling rain relieves the sultriness preceding a thunderstorm.

      All goes well, for just when opposition reaches its climax it changes

      over to its antithesis.'
