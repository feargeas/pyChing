judgment: 'THE CLINGING. Perseverance furthers.

  It brings success.

  Care of the cow brings good fortune.


  What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of

  the latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself

  something that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out.

  Everything that gives light is dependent on something to which it

  clings, in order that it may continue to shine.


  Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling

  to the earth. So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to

  what is right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earth is

  conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and

  makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the

  cosmos, he achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility.

  By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary

  dependence, man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place

  in the world.'
image: 'That which is bright rises twice:

  The image of FIRE.

  Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,

  Illumines the four quarters of the world.


  Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day. The

  two together represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function of

  light with respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature

  in the human world. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the

  light to spread farther and farther and to penetrate the nature of man

  ever more deeply.'

    text: 'The footprints run crisscross.

      If one is seriously intent, no blame.

      It is early morning and work begins. The mind has been closed to the

      outside world in sleep; now its connections with the world begin again.

      The traces of one''s impressions run crisscross. Activity and haste

      prevail. It is important then to preserve inner composure and not to

      allow oneself to be swept along by the bustle of life. If one is serious

      and composed, he can acquire the clarity of mind needed for coming to

      terms with the innumerable impressions that pour in. It is precisely at

      the beginning that serious concentration is important, because the

      beginning holds the seed of all that is to follow.'

    text: 'Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.

      Midday has come; the sun shines with a yellow light. Yellow is the color

      of measure and mean. Yellow light is therefore a symbol of the highest

      culture and art, whose consummate harmony consists in holding to the

      mean.'

    text: 'In the light of the setting sun,

      Men either beat the pot and sing

      Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.

      Misfortune.

      Here the end of the day has come. The light of the setting sun calls to

      mind the fact that life is transitory and conditional. Caught in this

      external bondage, men are usually robbed of their inner freedom as well.

      The sense of the transitoriness of life impels them to uninhibited

      revelry in order to enjoy life while it lasts, or else they yield to

      melancholy and spoil the precious time by lamenting the approach of old

      age. Both attitudes are wrong. To the superior man it makes no

      difference whether death comes early or late. He cultivates himself,

      awaits his allotted time, and in this way secures his fate.'

    text: 'Its coming is sudden;

      It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.

      Clarity of mind has the same relation to life that fire has to wood.

      Fire clings to wood, but also consumes it. Clarity of mind is rooted in

      life but can also consume it. Everything depends upon how the clarity

      functions. Here the image used is that of a meteor or a straw fire. A

      man who is excitable and restless may rise quickly to prominence but

      produces no lasting effects. Thus matters end badly when a man spends

      himself too rapidly and consumes himself like a meteor.'

    text: 'Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.

      Good fortune.

      Here the zenith of life has been reached. Were there no warning, one

      would at this point consume oneself like a flame. Instead, understanding

      the vanity of all things, one may put aside both hope and fear, and sigh

      and lament: if one is intent on retaining his clarity of mind, good

      fortune will come from this grief. For here we are dealing not with a

      passing mood, as in the nine in the third place, but with a real change

      of heart.'

    text: 'The king uses him to march forth and chastise.

      Then it is best to kill the leaders

      And take captive the followers. No blame.

      It is not the purpose of chastisement to impose punishment blindly but

      to create discipline. Evil must be cured at its roots. To eradicate evil

      in political life, it is best to kill the ringleaders and spare the

      followers. In educating oneself it is best to root out bad habits and

      tolerate those that are harmless. For asceticism that is too strict,

      like sentences of undue severity, fails in its purpose.'
