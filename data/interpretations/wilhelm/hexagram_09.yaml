judgment: 'THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL\

  Has success.\

  Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.


  This image refers to the state of affairs in China at the time when King

  Wên, who came originally from the west, was in the east at the court of

  the reigning tyrant Chou Hsin. The moment for action on a large scale

  had not yet arrived. King Wên could only keep the tyrant somewhat in

  check by friendly persuasion. Hence the image of many clouds, promising

  moisture and blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls. The

  situation is not unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate success,

  but there are still obstacles in the way, and we can merely take

  preparatory measures. Only through the small means of friendly

  persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has not yet come for

  sweeping measures. However, we may be able, to a limited extent, to act

  as a restraining and subduing influence. To carry out our purpose we

  need firm determination within and gentleness and adaptability in

  external relations.'
image: 'The wind drives across heaven:\

  The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL.\

  Thus the superior man\

  Refines the outward aspect of his nature.


  The wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet, being

  nothing but air, without solid body, it does not produce great or

  lasting effects. So also an individual, in times when he can produce no

  great effect in the outer world, can do nothing except refine the

  expression of his nature in small ways.'

    text: 'Return to the way.\

      How could there be blame in this?\

      Good fortune.

      It lies in the nature of a strong man to press forward. In so doing he

      encounters obstructions. Therefore he returns to the way suited to his

      situation, where he is free to advance or to retreat. In the nature of

      things this will bring good fortune, for it is wise and reasonable not

      to try to obtain anything by force.'

    text: 'He allows himself to be drawn into returning.\

      Good fortune.

      One would like to press forward, but before going farther one sees from

      the example of others like oneself that this way is blocked. In such a

      case, if the effort to push forward is not in harmony with the time, a

      reasonable and resolute man will not expose himself to a personal

      rebuff, but will retreat with others of like mind. This brings good

      fortune, because he does not needlessly jeopardize himself.'

    text: 'The spokes burst out of the wagon wheels.\

      Man and wife roll their eyes.

      Here an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the consciousness

      that the obstructing power is slight. But since, under the

      circumstances, power actually lies with the weak, this sudden offensive

      is doomed to failure. External conditions hinder the advance, just as

      loss of the wheel spokes stops the progress of a wagon. We do not yet

      heed this hint form fate, hence there are annoying arguments like those

      of a married couple. Naturally this is not a favorable state of thing,

      for though the situation may enable the weaker side to hold its ground,

      the difficulties are too numerous to permit of a happy result. In

      consequence even the strong man cannot so use his power as to exert the

      right influence on those around him. He experiences a rebuff where he

      expected an easy victory, and he thus compromises his dignity.'

    text: 'If you are sincere, blood vanishes and fear gives way.\

      No blame.

      If one is in the difficult and responsible position of counselor to a

      powerful man, on should restrain him in such a way that the threat of

      actual bloodshed may arise. Nonetheless, the power of disinterested

      truth is greater than all theses obstacles. It carries such weight that

      the end is achieved, and all danger of bloodshed and all fear disappear.'

    text: 'If you are sincere and loyally attached,\

      You are rich in your neighbor.

      Loyalty leads to firm ties because it means that each partner

      complements the other. In the weaker person loyalty consists in

      devotion, in the stronger it consists in trustworthiness. This relation

      of mutual reinforcement leads to a true wealth that is all the more

      apparent because it is not selfishly hoarded but is shared with friends.

      Pleasure shared is pleasure doubled.'

    text: 'The rain comes, there is rest.\

      This is due to the lasting effect of character.\

      Perseverance brings the woman into danger.\

      The moon is nearly full.\

      If the superior man persists,\

      Misfortune comes.

      Success is at hand. The wind has driven up the rain. A fixed standpoint

      has been reach. This has come about through the cumulation of small

      effects produced by reverence for a superior character. But a success

      thus secured bit by bit calls for great caution. It would be a dangerous

      illusion for anyone to think he could presume upon it. The female

      principle, the weak element that has won the victory, should never

      persist in vaunting it --- that would lead to danger. The dark power in

      the moon is strongest when the moon is almost full. When it is full and

      directly opposite the sun, its waning is inevitable. Under such

      circumstances one must be content with what has been achieved. To

      advance any further, before the appropriate time has come, would lead to

      misfortune.'
