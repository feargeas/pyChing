judgment: 'THE FAMILY. The perseverance of the woman furthers.


  The foundation of the family is the relationship between husband and

  wife. The tie that hold the family together lies in the loyalty and

  perseverance of the wife. The tie that holds the family together lies in

  the loyalty and perseverance of the wife. Her place is within (second

  line), while that of the husband is without (fifth line). It is in

  accord with the great laws of nature that husband and wife take their

  proper places. Within the family a strong authority is needed; this is

  represented by the parents. If the father is really a father and the son

  a son, if the elder brother fulfills his position, and the younger

  fulfills his, if the husband is really a husband and the wife a wife,

  then the family is in order. When the family is in order, all the social

  relationships of mankind will be in order.


  Three of the five social relationships are to be found within the family

  --- that between father and son, which is the relation of love, that

  between the husband and wife, which is the relation of chaste conduct,

  and that between elder and younger brother, which is the relation of

  correctness. The loving reverence of the son is then carried over to the

  prince in the form of faithfulness to duty; the affection and

  correctness of behavior existing between the two brothers are extended

  to a friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in

  the form of deference. The family is society in the embryo; it is the

  native soil on which performance of moral duty is made early through

  natural affection, so that within a small circle a basis of moral

  practice is created, and this is later widened to include human

  relationships in general.'
image: 'Wind comes forth from fire:

  The image of THE FAMILY.

  Thus the superior man has substance in his words

  And duration in his way of life.


  Heat creates energy: this is signified by the wind stirred up by the

  fire and issuing forth form it. This represents influence working from

  within outward. The same thing is needed in the regulation of the

  family. Here too the influence on others must proceed form one''s own

  person. In order to be capable of producing such an influence, one''s

  words must have power, and this they can have only if they are based on

  something real, just as flame depends on its fuel Words have influence

  only when they are pertinent and clearly related to definite

  circumstances. General discourses and admonitions have no effect

  whatsoever. Furthermore, the words must be supported by one''s entire

  conduct, just as the wind is made effective by am impression on others

  that they can adapt and conform to it. If words and conduct are not in

  accord and consistent, they will have no effect.'

    text: 'Firm seclusion within the family.

      Remorse disappears.

      The family must form a well-defined unit within which each member knows

      his place. From the beginning each child must be accustomed to firmly

      established rules of order, before ever its will is directed to other

      things. If we begin too late to enforce order, when the will of the

      child has already been overindulged, the whims and passions, grown

      stronger with the years, offer resistance and give cause for remorse. If

      we insist on order from the outset, occasions for remorse may arise ---

      in general social life these are unavoidable --- but the remorse always

      disappears again, and everything rights itself. For there is nothing

      easily avoided and more difficult to carry through than "breaking a

      child''s will."'

    text: 'She should not follow her whims.

      She must attend within to the food.

      Perseverance brings good fortune.

      The wife must always be guided by the will of the master of the house,

      be he father, husband, or grown son. There, without having to look for

      them, she has great and important duties. She must attend to the

      nourishment of her family and to the food for the sacrifice. IN this way

      she becomes the center of the social and religious life of the family,

      and her perseverance in this position brings good fortune to the whole

      house.

      In relation to general conditions, the counsel here is to seek nothing

      by means of force, but quietly to confine oneself to the duties at hand.'

    text: 'When tempers flare up in the family,

      Too great severity brings remorse.

      Good fortune nonetheless.

      When woman and child dally and laugh

      It leads in the end to humiliation.

      In the family the proper mean between severity and indulgence ought to

      prevail. Too great severity toward one''s own flesh and blood leads to

      remorse. The wise thing is to build strong dikes within which complete

      freedom of movement is allowed each individual. But in doubtful

      instances too great severity, despite occasional mistakes, is

      preferable, because it preserves discipline in the family, whereas too

      great weakness leads to disgrace.'

    text: 'She is the treasure of the house.

      Great good fortune.

      It is upon the woman of the house that the well-being of the family

      depends. Well-being prevails when expenditures and income are soundly

      balanced. This leads to great good fortune. In the sphere of public

      life, this line refers to the faithful steward whose measures further

      the general welfare.'

    text: 'As a king he approaches his family.

      Fear not.

      Good fortune.

      A king is the symbol of a fatherly man who is richly endowed in mind. He

      does nothing to make himself feared; on the contrary, the whole family

      can trust him, because love governs their intercourse. His character of

      itself exercises the right influence.'

      In the end good fortune comes.

      In the last analysis, order within the family depends on the character

      of the master of the house. If he cultivates his personality so that it

      works impressively through the force of inner truth, all goes well with

      the family. In a ruling position one must of his own accord assume

      responsibility.'
