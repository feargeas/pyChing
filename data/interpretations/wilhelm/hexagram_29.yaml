judgment: 'The Abysmal repeated.

  If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,

  And whatever you do succeeds.


  Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the

  example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and

  on, and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does

  not shrink from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can

  make it lose its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under

  all conditions. Thus likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with

  difficulties, the heart can penetrate the meaning of the situation. And

  once we have gained inner mastery of a problem, it will come about

  naturally that the action we take will succeed. In danger all that

  counts is really carrying out all that has to be done --- thoroughness

  --- and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in the

  danger.


  Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective

  measure. Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every

  attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water,

  separating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of

  danger to protect themselves against attacks from without and against

  turmoil within.'
image: 'Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its goal:

  The image of the Abysmal repeated.

  Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue

  And carries on the business of teaching.


  Water reaches its goal by flowing continually. It fills up every

  depression before it flows on. The superior man follows its example; he

  is concerned that goodness should be an established attribute of

  character rather than an accidental and isolated occurrence. So likewise

  in teaching others everything depends on consistency, for it is only

  through repetition that the pupil makes the material his own.'

      In the abyss one falls into a pit.

      Misfortune.

      By growing used to what is dangerous, a man can easily allow it to

      become part of him. He is familiar with it and grows used to evil. With

      this he has lost the right way, and misfortune is the natural result.'

    text: 'The abyss is dangerous.

      One should strive to attain small things only.

      When we are in danger we ought not to attempt to get out of it

      immediately, regardless of circumstances; at first we must content

      ourselves with not being overcome by it. We must calmly weigh the

      conditions of the time and by satisfied with small gains, because for

      the time being a great success cannot be attained. A spring flows only

      sparingly at first, and tarries for some time before it makes its way in

      to the open.'

      In danger like this, pause at first and wait,

      Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.

      Do not act this way.

      Here every step, forward or backward, leads into danger. Escape is out

      of the question. Therefore we must not be misled into action, as a

      result of which we should only bog down deeper in the danger;

      disagreeable as it may be to remain in such a situation, we must wait

      until a way out shows itself.'

      Earthen vessels

      Simply handed in through the Window.

      There is certainly no blame in this.

      In times of danger ceremonious forms are dropped. What matters most is

      sincerity. Although as a rule it is customary for an official to present

      certain introductory gifts and recommendations before he is appointed,

      here everything is simplified to the utmost. The gifts are

      insignificant, there is no one to sponsor him, he introduces himself;

      yet all this need not be humiliating if only there is the honest

      intention of mutual help in danger. Still another idea is suggested. The

      window is the place through which light enters the room. If in difficult

      times we want to enlighten someone, we must begin with that which is in

      itself lucid and proceed quite simply from that point on.'

    text: 'The abyss is not filled to overflowing,

      It is filled only to the rim.

      No blame.

      Danger comes because one is too ambitious. In order to flow out of a

      ravine, water does not rise higher than the lowest point of the rim. So

      likewise a man when in danger has only to proceed along the line of

      least resistance; thus he reaches the goal. Great labors cannot be

      accomplished in such times; it is enough to get out of the danger.'

      Misfortune.

      A man who in the extremity of danger has lost the right way and is

      irremediably entangled in his sins has no prospect of escape. He is like

      a criminal who sits shackled behind thorn hedged prison walls.'
