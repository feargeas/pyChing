judgment: 'RETREAT. Success.

  In what is small, perseverance furthers.


  Conditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time are

  advancing. In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to be

  confused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any

  circumstances, whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful

  not to miss the right moment while we are in full possession of power

  and position. Then we shall be able to interpret the signs of the time

  before it is too late and to prepare for provisional retreat instead of

  being drawn into a desperate life-and-death struggle. Thus we do not

  simple abandon the field to the opponent; we make it difficult for him

  to advance by showing perseverance in single acts of resistance. In this

  way we prepare, while retreating, for the counter-movement.

  Understanding the laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is not

  easy. The meaning that lies hidden in such a time is important.'
image: 'Mountain under heaven: the image of RETREAT.

  Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,

  Not angrily but with reserve.


  The mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally

  comes to a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into

  the distance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of

  the superior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own

  thoughts as the inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for

  hatred is a form of subjective involvement by which we are bound to the

  hated object. The superior man shows strength (heaven) in that he brings

  the inferior man to a standstill (mountain) by his dignified reserve.'

    text: 'At the tail in retreat. This is dangerous.

      One must not wish to undertake anything.

      Since the hexagram is the picture of something that is retreating, the

      lowest line represents the tail and the top line the head. In a retreat

      it is advantageous to be at the front. Here one is at the back, in

      immediate contact with the pursuing enemy. This is dangerous, and under

      such circumstances it is not advisable to undertake anything. Keeping

      still is the easiest way of escaping from the threatening danger.'

    text: 'He holds him fast with yellow oxhide.

      No one can tear him loose.

      Yellow is the color of the middle. It indicates that which is correct

      and in line with duty. Oxhide is strong and not to be torn. While the

      superior men retreat and the inferior press after them, the inferior man

      represented here holds on so firmly and tightly to the superior man that

      the latter cannot shake him off. And because he is in quest of what is

      right and so strong in purpose, he reaches his goal. Thus the line

      confirms what is said in the Judgment: "In what is small" --- here

      equivalent to "in the inferior man" --- "perseverance furthers."'

    text: 'A halted retreat

      Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.

      To retain people as men- and maidservants

      Brings good fortune.

      When it is time to retreat it is both unpleasant and dangerous to be

      held back, because then one no longer has freedom of action. In such a

      case the only expedient is to take into one''s service, so to speak,

      those who refuse to let one go, so that one may at least keep one''s

      initiative and not fall helplessly under their domination. But even with

      this expedient the situation is far from satisfactory --- for what can

      one hope to accomplish with such servants?'

    text: 'Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man

      And downfall to the inferior man.

      In retreating the superior man is intent on taking his departure

      willingly and in all friendliness. He easily adjusts his mind to

      retreat, because in retreating he does not have to do violence to his

      convictions. The only one who suffers is the inferior man from whom he

      retreats, who will degenerate when deprived of the guidance of the

      superior man.'

    text: 'Friendly retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune.

      It is the business of the superior man to recognize in time that the

      moment for retreat has come. If the right moment is chosen, the retreat

      can be carried out within the forms of perfect friendliness, without the

      necessity of disagreeable discussions. Yet, for all the observance of

      amenities, absolute firmness of decision is necessary if one is not to

      be led astray by irrelevant considerations.'

    text: 'Cheerful retreat. Everything serves to further.

      The situation is unequivocal. Inner detachment has become an established

      fact, and we are at liberty to depart. When one sees the way ahead thus

      clearly, free of all doubt, a cheerful mood sets in, and one chooses

      what is right without further thought. Such a clear path ahead always

      leads to the good.'
