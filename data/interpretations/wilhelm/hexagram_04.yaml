judgment: 'YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.\

  It is not I who seek the young fool;\

  The young fool seeks me.\

  At the first oracle I inform him.\

  If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.\

  If he importunes, I give him no information.\

  Perseverance furthers.


  In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of

  it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude

  toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be

  conscious of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher.

  Without this modesty and this interest there is no guarantee that he has

  the necessary receptivity, which should express itself in respectful

  acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason why the teacher must wait

  to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only thus can the

  instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.


  A teacher\''s answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and

  definite like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be

  accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If

  mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to

  annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence, just as the

  oracle gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions

  implying doubt.


  Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are

  mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram

  counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.'
image: 'A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:\

  The image of YOUTH.\

  Thus the superior man fosters his character\

  By thoroughness in all that he does.


  A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling up all

  the hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed by

  thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily

  fills up all gaps and so flows onward.'

    text: 'To make a fool develop\

      It furthers one to apply discipline.\

      The fetters should be removed.\

      To go on in this way bring humiliation.

      Law is the beginning of education. Youth in its inexperience is inclined

      at first to take everything carelessly and playfully. It must be shown

      the seriousness of life. A certain measure of taking oneself in hand,

      brought about by strict discipline, is a good thing. He who plays with

      life never amounts to anything. However, discipline should not

      degenerate into drill. Continuous drill has a humiliating effect and

      cripples a man\''s powers.'

    text: 'To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune.\

      To know how to take women\

      Brings good fortune.\

      The son is capable of taking charge of the household.

      These lines picture a man who has no external power, but who has enough

      strength of mind to bear his burden of responsibility. He has the inner

      superiority and that enable him to tolerate with kindliness the

      shortcomings of human folly. The same attitude is owed to women as the

      weaker sex. One must understand them and give them recognition in a

      spirit of chivalrous consideration. Only this combination of inner

      strength with outer reserve enables one to take on the responsibility of

      directing a larger social body with real success.'

    text: 'Take not a maiden who, when she sees a man of bronze,\

      Loses possession of herself.\

      Nothing furthers.

      A weak, inexperienced man, struggling to rise, easily loses his own

      individuality when he slavishly imitates a strong personality of higher

      station. He is like a girl throwing herself away when she meets a strong

      man. Such a servile approach should not be encouraged, because it is bad

      both for the youth and the teacher. A girl owes it to her dignity to

      wait until she is wooed. In both cases it is undignified to offer

      oneself, and no good comes of accepting such an offer.'

    text: 'Entangled folly bring humiliation.

      For youthful folly it is the most hopeless thing to entangle itself in

      empty imaginings. The more obstinately it clings to such unreal

      fantasies, the more certainly will humiliation overtake it.

      Often the teacher, when confronted with such entangled folly, has no

      other course but to leave the fool to himself for a time, not sparing

      him the humiliation that results. This is frequently the only means of

      rescue.'

    text: 'Childlike folly brings good fortune.

      An inexperienced person who seeks instruction in a childlike and

      unassuming way is on the right path, for the man devoid of arrogance who

      subordinated himself to his teacher will certainly be helped.'

    text: 'In punishing folly\

      It does not further one\

      To commit transgressions.\

      The only thing that furthers\

      Is to prevent transgressions.

      Sometimes an incorrigible fool must be punished. He who will not heed

      will be made to feel. This punishment is quite different from a

      preliminary shaking up. But the penalty should not be imposed in anger;

      it must be restricted to an objective guarding against unjustified

      excesses. Punishment is never an end in itself but serves merely to

      restore order.

      This applies not only in regard to education but also in regard to the

      measures taken by a government against a populace guilty of

      transgressions. Governmental interference should always be merely

      preventive and should have as its sole aim the establishment of public

      security and peace.'
