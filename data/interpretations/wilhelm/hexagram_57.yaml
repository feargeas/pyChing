judgment: 'THE GENTLE. Success through what is small.\

  It furthers one to have somewhere to go.\

  It furthers one to see the great man.


  Penetration produces gradual and inconspicuous effects. It should be

  effected not by an act of violation but by influence that never lapses.

  Results of this kind are less striking to the eye than those won by

  surprise attack, but they are more enduring and more complete. If one

  would produce such effects, one must have a clearly defined goal, for

  only when the penetrating influence works always in the same direction

  can the object be attained. Small strength can achieve its purpose only

  by subordinating itself to an eminent man who is capable of creating

  order.'
image: 'Winds following one upon the other:\

  The image of THE GENTLY PENETRATING.\

  Thus the superior man\

  Spreads his commands abroad\

  And carries out his undertakings.


  The penetrating quality of the wind depends upon its ceaselessness. This

  is what makes it so powerful; time is its instrument. In the same way

  the ruler\''s thought should penetrate the soul of the people. This too

  requires a lasting influence brought about by enlightenment and command.

  Only when the command has been assimilated by the people is action in

  accordance with it possible. Action without preparation of the ground

  only frightens and repels.'

    text: 'In advancing and in retreating,\

      The perseverance of a warrior furthers.

      Inborn gentleness is often carried to the point of indecisiveness. One

      does not feel strong enough to advance resolutely. A thousand doubts

      crop up; one is, however, not minded to withdraw but drifts indecisively

      to and fro. In such a situation, a military decisiveness is the proper

      thing, so that one resolutely does what order demands. Resolute

      discipline is far better than irresolute license.'

      Priests and magicians are used in great number.\

      Good fortune. No blame.

      At times one has to deal with hidden enemies, intangible influences that

      slink into dark corners and from this hiding affect people by

      suggestion. In instances like this, it is necessary to trace these

      things back to the most secret recesses, in order to determine the

      nature of the influences to be dealt with. This is the task of the

      priests; removing the influences is the task of the magicians. The very

      anonymity of such plotting requires an especially vigorous and

      indefatigable effort, but this is well worth while. For when such

      elusive influences are brought into the light and branded, they lose

      their power over people.'

    text: 'Repeated penetration. Humiliation.

      Penetrating reflection must not be pushed too far, lest it cripple the

      power of decision. After a matter has been thoroughly pondered, it is

      essential to form a decision and to act. Repeated deliberation brings

      fresh doubts and scruples, and thereby humiliation, because one shows

      oneself unable to act.'

      During the hunt\

      Three kinds of game are caught.

      When a responsible position and accumulated experience lead one to

      combine innate modesty with energetic action, great success is assured.

      The three kinds of animals referred to served for offerings to the gods,

      for feasting guests, and for everyday consumption. When the catch

      answered all three purposes, the hunt was considered especially

      successful.'

      Remorse vanishes.\

      Nothing that does not further.\

      No beginning, but an end.\

      Before the change, three days.\

      After the change, three days.\

      Good fortune.

      In the situation described in Ku, WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED

      (18), an entirely new point of departure must be set up, whereas

      here it is only a question of reforms. The beginning has not been good,

      but the moment has been reached when a new direction can be taken.

      Change and improvement are called for. Such steps must be undertaken

      with steadfastness, that is, with a firm and correct attitude of mind;

      then they will succeed, and remorse will disappear. But it must be

      remembered that such improvements require careful consideration. Before

      a change is made, it must be pondered over again and again. After the

      change is made, it is necessary to note carefully for some time after

      how the improvements bear the test of actuality. Such careful work is

      accompanied by good fortune.'

      He loses his property and his ax.\

      Perseverance brings misfortune.

      A man\''s understanding is sufficiently penetrating. He follows up

      injurious influences into the most secret corners. But he no longer has

      the strength to combat them decisively. In this case any attempt to

      penetrate into the personal domain of darkness would only bring harm.'
