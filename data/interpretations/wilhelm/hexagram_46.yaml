judgment: 'PUSHING UPWARD has supreme success.\

  One must see the great man.\

  Fear not.\

  Departure toward the south\

  Brings good fortune.


  The pushing upward of the good elements encounters no obstruction and is

  therefore accompanied by great success. The pushing upward is made

  possible not by violence but by modesty and adaptability. Since the

  individual is borne along by the propitiousness of the time, he

  advances. He must go to see authoritative people. He need not be afraid

  to do this, because success is assured. But he must set to work, for

  activity (this is the meaning of \"the south\") brings good fortune.'
image: 'Within the earth, wood grows:\

  The image of PUSHING UPWARD.\

  Thus the superior man of devoted character\

  Heaps up small things\

  In order to achieve something high and great.


  Adapting itself to obstacles and bending around them, wood in the earth

  grows upward without haste and without rest. Thus too the superior man

  is devoted in character and never pauses in his progress.'

    text: 'Pushing upward that meets with confidence\

      Brings great good fortune.

      This situation at the beginning of ascent. Just as wood draws strength

      for its upward push from the root, which in itself is in the lowest

      place, so the power to rise comes from this low and obscure station. But

      there is a spiritual affinity with the rulers above, and this solidarity

      creates the confidence needed to accomplish something.'

    text: 'If one is sincere,\

      It furthers one to bring even a small offering.\

      No blame.

      Here a strong man is presupposed. It is true that he does not fit in

      with his environment, inasmuch as he is too brusque and pays too little

      attention to form. But as he is upright in character, he meets with

      response, and his lack of outward form does no harm. Here uprightness is

      the outcome of sound qualities of character, whereas in the

      corresponding line of the preceding hexagram it is the result of innate

      humility.'

    text: 'One pushes upward into an empty city.

      All obstructions that generally block progress fall away here. Things

      proceed with remarkable ease. Unhesitatingly one follows this road, in

      order to profit by one\''s success. Seen from without, everything seems

      to be in the best of order. However, no promise of good fortune is

      added. It is a question how long such unobstructed success can last. But

      it is wise not to yield to such misgivings, because they only inhibit

      one\''s power. Instead, the point is to profit by the propitiousness of

      time.'

    text: 'The king offers him Mount Ch\''i.\

      Good fortune. No blame.

      Mount Ch\''i is in western China, the homeland of King Wên, whose son,

      the Duke of Chou, added the words to the individual lines. The

      pronouncement takes us back to a time when the Chou dynasty was coming

      into power. At that time King Wên introduced his illustrious helpers to

      the god of his native mountain, and they received their places in the

      halls of the ancestors by the side of the ruler. This indicates a stage

      in which pushing upward attains its goal. One acquires fame in the sight

      of gods and men, is received into the circle of those who foster the

      spiritual life of the nation, and thereby attains a significance that

      endures beyond time.'

    text: 'Perseverance brings good fortune.\

      One pushes upward by steps.

      When a man is advancing farther and farther, it is important for him not

      to become intoxicated by success. Precisely when he experiences great

      success it is necessary to remain sober and not to try to skip any

      stages; he must go on slowly, step by step, as though hesitant. Only

      such calm, steady progress, overleaping nothing, leads to the goal.'

    text: 'Pushing upward in darkness.\

      It furthers one\

      To be unremittingly persevering.

      He who pushes upward blindly deludes himself. He knows only advance, not

      retreat. But this means exhaustion. In such a case it is important to be

      constantly mindful that one must be conscientious and consistent and

      must remain so. Only thus does one become free of blind impulse, which

      is always harmful.'
