judgment: 'APPROACH has supreme success.\

  Perseverance furthers.\

  When the eighth month comes,\

  There will be misfortune.


  The hexagram as a whole points to a time of joyous, hopeful progress.

  Spring is approaching. Joy and forbearance bring high and low nearer

  together. Success is certain. But we must work with determination and

  perseverance to make full use of the propitiousness of the time. And on

  thing more: spring does not last forever. In the eighth month the

  aspects are reversed. Then only two strong, light lines are left; these

  do not advance but are in retreat (see next hexagram). We must take heed

  of this change in good time. If we meet evil before it becomes reality

  --- before it has even begun to stir --- we can master it.'
image: 'The earth above the lake:\

  The image of APPROACH.\

  Thus the superior man is inexhaustible\

  In his will to teach,\

  And without limits\

  In his tolerance and protection of the people.


  The earth borders upon the lake from above. This symbolizes the approach

  and condescension of the man of higher position to those beneath him.

  The two parts of the image indicate what his attitude toward these

  people will be. Just as the lake is inexhaustible in depth, so the sage

  is inexhaustible in his readiness to teach mankind, and just as the

  earth is boundlessly wide, sustaining and caring for all creatures on

  it, so the sage sustains and cares for all people and excludes no part

  of humanity.'

    text: 'Joint approach.\

      Perseverance brings good fortune.

      The good begins to prevail and to find response in influential circles.

      This in turn is an incentive to men of ability. IT is well to join this

      upward trend, but we must not let ourselves be carried away by the

      current of the time; we must adhere perseveringly to what is right. This

      bring good fortune.'

    text: 'Joint approach.\

      Good fortune.\

      Everything furthers.

      When the stimulus to approach comes from a high place, and when a man

      has the inner strength and consistency that need no admonition, good

      fortune will ensue. Nor need the future cause any concern. He is well

      aware that everything earthly is transitory, and that a descent follows

      upon every rise, but need not be confused by this universal law of fate.

      Everything serves to further. Therefore he will travel the paths of life

      swiftly, honestly, and valiantly.'

    text: 'Comfortable approach.\

      Nothing that would further.\

      If one is induced to grieve over it,\

      One becomes free of blame.

      Things are going well for a man: he achieves power and influence. But in

      this lies the danger that he may relax, and confident of his position,

      allow the easygoing, careless mood to show itself in his dealings with

      other people. This would inevitably be harmful. But there is possibility

      of a change of mood. If he regrets his mistaken attitude and feels the

      responsibility of an influential position, he frees himself of faults.'

    text: 'Complete approach.\

      No blame.

      While the three lower lines indicate rise to power and influence, the

      three upper lines show the attitude of persons in higher position toward

      those of lower rank for whom they procure influence. Here is shown the

      open-minded approach of a person of high rank to a man of ability whom

      he draws in to his own circle, regardless of class prejudice. This is

      very favorable.'

    text: 'Wise approach.\

      This is right for a great prince.\

      Good fortune.

      A prince, or anyone in a leading position, must have the wisdom to

      attract to himself people of ability who are expert in directing

      affairs. His wisdom consists both in selecting the right people and in

      allowing those chosen to have a free hand without interference from him.

      For only through such self-restraint will he find the experts needed to

      satisfy all of his requirements.'

    text: 'Great hearted approach.\

      Good fortune. No blame.

      A sage who has put the world behind him and who in spirit has already

      withdrawn from life may, under certain circumstances, decide to return

      once more to the here and now and to approach other men. This means

      great good fortune for the men whom he teaches and helps. And for him

      this great hearted humbling of himself is blameless.'
