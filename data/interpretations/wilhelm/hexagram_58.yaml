judgment: 'THE JOYOUS. Success.

  Perseverance is favorable.


  The joyous mood is infectious and therefore brings success. But joy must

  be based on steadfastness if it is not to degenerate into uncontrolled

  mirth. Truth and strength must dwell in the heart, while gentleness

  reveals itself in social intercourse. In this way one assumes the right

  attitude toward God and man and achieves something. Under certain

  conditions, intimidation without gentleness may achieve something

  momentarily, but not for all time. When, on the other hand, the hearts

  of men are won by friendliness, they are led to take all hardships upon

  themselves willingly, and if need be will not shun death itself, so

  great is the power of joy over men.'
image: 'Lakes resting one on the other:

  The image of THE JOYOUS.

  Thus the superior man joins with his friends

  For discussion and practice.


  A lake evaporates upward and thus gradually dries up; but when two lakes

  are joined they do not dry up so readily, for one replenishes the other.

  It is the same in the field of knowledge. Knowledge should be a

  refreshing and vitalizing force. It becomes so only through stimulating

  intercourse with congenial friends with whom one holds discussion and

  practices application of the truths of life. In this way learning

  becomes many-sided and takes on a cheerful lightness, whereas there is

  always something ponderous and one-sided about the learning of the

  self-taught.'

    text: 'Contented joyousness. Good fortune.

      A quiet, wordless, self-contained joy, desiring nothing from without and

      resting content with everything, remains free of all egotistic likes and

      dislikes. In this freedom lies good fortune, because it harbors the

      quiet security of a heart fortified within itself.'

    text: 'Sincere joyousness. Good fortune.

      Remorse disappears.

      We often find ourselves associating with inferior people in whose

      company we are tempted by pleasures that are inappropriate for the

      superior man. To participate in such pleasures would certainly bring

      remorse, for a superior man can find no real satisfaction in low

      pleasures. When, recognizing this, a man does not permit his will to

      swerve, so that he does not find such ways agreeable, not even dubious

      companions will venture to proffer any base pleasures, because he would

      not enjoy them. Thus every cause for regret is removed.'

    text: 'Coming joyousness. Misfortune.

      True joy must spring from within. But if one is empty within and wholly

      given over to the world, idle pleasures come streaming in from without.

      This is what many people welcome as diversion. Those who lack inner

      stability and therefore need amusement, will always find opportunity of

      indulgence. They attract external pleasures by the emptiness of their

      natures. Thus they lose themselves more and more, which of course has

      bad results.'

    text: 'Joyousness that is weighed is not at peace.

      After ridding himself of mistakes a man has joy.

      Often a man finds himself weighing the choice between various kinds of

      pleasures, and so long as he has not decided which kind he will choose,

      the higher or the lower, he has no inner peace. Only when he clearly

      recognizes that passion brings suffering, can he make up his mind to

      turn away from the lower pleasures and to strive for the higher. Once

      this decision is sealed, he finds true joy and peace, and inner conflict

      is overcome.'

    text: 'Sincerity toward disintegrating influences is dangerous.

      Dangerous elements approach even the best of men. If a man permits

      himself to have anything to do with them, their disintegrating influence

      acts slowly but surely, and inevitable brings dangers in its train. But

      if he recognizes the situation and can comprehend the danger, he knows

      how to protect himself and remains unharmed.'

    text: 'Seductive joyousness.

      A vain nature invites diverting pleasures and must suffer accordingly

      (cf. the six in the third place). If a man is unstable within, the

      pleasures of the world that he does not shun have so powerful an

      influence that he is swept along by them. Here it is no longer a

      question of danger, of good fortune or misfortune. He has given up

      direction of his own life, and what becomes of him depends upon chance

      and external influences.'
