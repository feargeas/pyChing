judgment: 'THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.

  Perseverance furthers.

  Not eating at home brings good fortune.

  It furthers one to cross the great water.


  To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth

  in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is

  honored by the ruler. The trigram Ch''ein points to strong creative

  power; Kên indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity

  and to the daily renewal of character. Only through such daily

  self-renewal can a man continue at the height of his powers. Force of

  habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in periods when there is a

  great storing up of energy, everything depends on the power of the

  personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the case of

  the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an

  advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one''s bread by entering

  upon public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even

  great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water,

  succeed.'
image: 'Heaven within the mountain:

  The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.

  Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many sayings of antiquity

  And many deeds of the past,

  In order to strengthen his character thereby.


  Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the words and

  deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to

  strengthen and elevate their own characters. The way to study the past

  is not to confine oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through

  application of this knowledge, to give actuality to the past.'

    text: 'Danger is at hand. It furthers one to desist.

      A man wishes to make vigorous advance, but circumstances present an

      obstacle. He sees himself held back firmly. If he should attempt to

      force an advance, it would lead him into misfortune. Therefore it is

      better for him to compose himself and to wait until an outlet is offered

      for release of his stored-up energies.'

    text: 'The axletrees are taken from the wagon.

      Here advance is checked just as in the third line of THE TAMING POWER OF

      THE SMALL (9). However, in the later the restraining force is

      slight; thus a conflict arises between the propulsive and the

      restraining movement, as a result of which the spokes fall out of the

      wagon wheels, while here the restraining force is absolutely superior;

      hence no struggle takes place. One submits and removes the axletrees

      from the wagon --- in other words, contents himself with waiting. In

      this way energy accumulates for a vigorous advance later on.'

    text: 'A good horse that follows others.

      Awareness of danger,

      With perseverance, furthers.

      Practice chariot driving and armed defense daily.

      It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

      The way opens; the hindrance has been cleared away. A man is in contact

      with a strong will acting in the same direction as his own, and goes

      forward like one good horse following another. But danger still

      threatens, and he must remain aware of it, or he will be robbed of his

      firmness. Thus he must acquire skill on the one hand in what will take

      him forward, and on the other in what will protect him against

      unforeseen attacks. It is good in such a pass to have a goal toward

      which to strive.'

    text: 'The headboard of a young bull.

      Great good fortune.

      This line and the one following it are the two that tame the

      forward-pushing lower lines. Before a bull''s horns grow out, a

      headboard is fastened to its forehead, so that later when the horns

      appear they cannot do harm. A good way to restrain wild force is to

      forestall it. By so doing one achieves an easy and great success.'

    text: 'The tusk of a gelded boar.

      Good fortune.

      Here the restraining of the impetuous forward drive is achieved in an

      indirect way. A boar''s tusk is in itself dangerous, but if the boar''s

      nature is altered, the tusk is no longer a menace. Thus also where men

      are concerned, wild force should not be combated directly; instead, its

      roots should be eradicated.'

    text: 'One attains the way of heaven.

      Success.

      The time of obstruction is past. The energy long dammed up by inhibition

      forces its way out and achieves great success. This refers to a man who

      is honored by the ruler and whose principles now prevail and shape the

      world.'
