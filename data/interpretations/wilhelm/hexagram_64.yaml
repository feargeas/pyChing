  But if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing,\

  Gets his tail in the water,\

  There is nothing that would further.


  The conditions are difficult. The task is great and full of

  responsibility. It is nothing less than that of leading the world out of

  confusion back to order. But it is a task that promises success, because

  there is a goal that can unite the forces now tending in different

  directions. At first, however, one must move warily, like an old fox

  walking over ice. The caution of a fox walking over ice is proverbial in

  China. His ears are constantly alert to the cracking of the ice, as he

  carefully and circumspectly searches out the safest spots. A young fox

  who as yet has not acquired this caution goes ahead boldly, and it may

  happen that he falls in and gets his tail wet when he is almost across

  the water. Then of course his effort has been all in vain. Accordingly,

  in times \"before completion,\" deliberation and caution are the

  prerequisites of success.'

  When fire, which by nature flames upward, is above, and water, which

  investigate the nature of the forces in question and ascertain their

  proper place. If we can bring these forces to bear in the right place,

  they will have the desired effect and completion will be achieved. But

  in order to handle external forces properly, we must above all arrive at

  the correct standpoint ourselves, for only from this vantage can we work

  correctly.'

      In times of disorder there is a temptation to advance oneself as rapidly

      as possible in order to accomplish something tangible. But this

      enthusiasm leads only to failure and humiliation if the time for

      achievement has not yet arrived. In such time it is wise to spare

      Here again the time to act has not yet come. But the patience needed is

      indefinitely, this would not lead to any success. Instead, an individual

      must develop in himself the strength that will enable him to go forward.

      He must have a vehicle, as it were, to effect the crossing. But he must

      for the time being use the brakes. Patience in the highest sense means

      putting brakes on strength. Therefore he must not fall asleep and lose

      sight of the goal. If he remains strong and steadfast in his resolve,

      an atmosphere of mutual trust, and the time of waiting is passed in

      conviviality. Since the new era is hard on the threshold, there is no

      blame in this. But one must be careful in all this to keep within proper

      bounds. If in his exuberance a man gets drunk, he forfeits the

      favorableness of the situation through his intemperance.

      NOTE. The hexagram AFTER COMPLETION (63) represents a gradual

      transition from a time of ascent past a peak of culture to a time of

      standstill. The hexagram BEFORE COMPLETION (64) represents a

      transition from chaos to order. This hexagram comes at the end of the

      Book of Changes. It points to the fact that every end contains a new

      beginning. Thus it gives hope to men. The Book of Changes is a book of

      the future.

      []{#Consulting_Oracle}

      ## Consulting the Oracle

      ### 1. The Yarrow-Stalk Oracle

      The oracle is consulted with the help of yarrow stalks. Fifty stalks are

      used for this purpose. One is put aside and plays no further part. The

      remaining 49 stalks are first divided into two heaps \[at random\].

      Thereupon one stalk is taken from the right-hand heap and put between

      the ring finger and the little finger of the left hand. Then the

      left-hand heap is placed in the left hand, and the right hand takes from

      it bundles of 4, until there are 4 or fewer stalks remaining. This

      remainder is placed between the ring finger and the middle finger of the

      left hand. Next the right-hand heap is placed in the left hand and

      counted off by fours, and the remainder (4 or fewer stalks) is placed

      between the middle finger and the forefinger of the left hand. The sum

      of the stalks now between the fingers of the left hand is either 9 or 5.

      (The various possibilities are 1+4+4, or 1+3+1, or 1+2+2, or 1+1+3; it

      follows that the number 5 is easier to obtain than the number 9.) At

      this first counting of of the stalks, the first stalk --- held between

      the little finger and the ring finger --- is disregarded as

      supernumerary, hence it follows: 9 = 8, and 5 = 4.

      The number 4 is regarded as a complete unit, to which the numerical

      value 3 is assigned. The number 8, on the other hand, is regarded as a

      double unit and is reckoned as having only the numerical value 2.

      Therefore, if at the first count 9 stalks are left over, they count as

      2; if 5 are left, they count as 3. These stalks are now laid aside for

      the time being.

      Then the remaining stalks are gathered together again and divided anew.

      Once more one takes a stalk from the pile on the right and places it

      between the ring finger and the little finger of the left hand; then one

      counts off the stalks as before. This time the sum of the remainders is

      either 8 or 4. (The possible combinations being 1+4+3, or 1+3+4, or

      1+1+2, or 1+2+1; so that this time the chances of obtaining 8 or 4 are

      equal. The 8 counts as 2, the 4 counts as 3.

      The procedure is carried out a third time with the remaining stalks, and

      again the sum of the remainders is 8 or 4.

      Now, from the numerical values assigned to each of the three composite

      remainders, a line is formed.

      If the resulting numerical sum is 9, the so-called old yang. This

      becomes a positive line that moves and must therefore be taken into

      account in the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated

      by the symbol \"---ө---\" or \"o\".

      If the resulting numerical sum is 6, the so-called old yin. This becomes

      a negative line that moves and is therefore to be taken into account in

      the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated by the

      symbol \"---x---\" or \"x\".

      If the resulting numerical sum is 7, the so-called young yang, this

      becomes a positive line that is at rest and therefore not taken into

      account in the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated

      by the symbol \"[      ]{.c11}\".

      If the resulting numerical sum is 8, the so-called young yin, this

      becomes a negative line that is at rest and therefore not taken into

      account in the interpretation of the individual lines. It is designated

      by the symbol \"― ―\".

      This procedure is repeated six times, and thus a hexagram of six lines

      is built up. When a hexagram consists entirely of non-moving lines, the

      oracle takes into account only the idea represented by the hexagram as a

      whole, as set down in the Judgment by King Wên and in the Commentary on

      the Decision by Confucius, together with the Image.

      If there are one or more moving lines in the hexagram, the words

      appended by the Duke of Chou to the given line or lines are also to be

      considered. His words therefore carry the superscription, \"Nine in the

      xth place\", or \"Six in the xth place\".

      []{#moving_lines}\

      ### Moving Lines Give Rise To A New Hexagram

      Furthermore, the movement, i.e., change in the lines, gives rise to a

      new hexagram, the meaning of which must also be taken into account. For

      instance, when we get hexagram 56 showing a moving line in the

      fourth place,

      ![Trigram 7](images/trigram7.png){#Image149 align="absmiddle" width="33"

      height="24" border="0"} [9]{.c12}\

      ![Trigram 4](images/trigram4.png){#Image148 align="absmiddle" width="33"

      height="24" border="0"}

      we must take into account not only the text and the Image belonging to

      this hexagram as a whole, but also the text that goes with the fourth

      line, and in addition both the text and the Image belonging to hexagram

      52.

      ![Trigram 4](images/trigram4.png){#Image151 align="absmiddle" width="33"

      height="24" border="0"}\

      ![Trigram 4](images/trigram4.png){#Image150 align="absmiddle" width="33"

      height="24" border="0"}

      Thus hexagram 56 would be the starting point of a development leading,

      by reason of the situation in the fourth place and the appended counsel,

      to the final situation, i.e., hexagram 52. In the second hexagram the

      text belonging to the moving line is disregarded.

      ### 2. The Coin Oracle

      In addition to the method of the yarrow-stalk oracle, there is in use a

      shorter method employing coins: for this as a rule old Chinese bronze

      coins, with a hole in the middle and an inscription on one side, are

      used. Three coins are taken up and thrown down together, and each throw

      gives a line. The inscribed side counts as yin, with the value 2, and

      the reverse side counts as yang, with the value 3. From this the

      character of the line is derived. If all three coins are yang, the line

      is a 9; if all three are yin, it is a 6.

      Two yin and one yang yield a 7, and two yang and one yin yield an 8. In

      looking up the hexagrams in the Book of Changes, one proceeds as with

      the yarrow-stalk oracle.

      ### 3. Mathematical Analysis & Alternate Coin Method

      This section is not in the Wilhelm Baynes translation, it is an added

      section. Using the three coins as described above results in an equal

      probability of obtaining the value 2 or 3 with each coin, whereas using

      the yarrow stalks the probabilities in each of the three steps are not

      equal.

      In the description of using the yarrow stalks above it makes note of the

      fact that in the first step \"the number 5 is easier to obtain than the

      number 9\" by a ratio of 3:1 while in the second and third steps \"the

      chances of obtaining 8 or 4 are equal\".

      Therefore, the number of options are 4 \* 2 \* 2 = 16 and the various

      results can be shown as a probability tree. A summary of the results is:

      ::: c7

      +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

      |             | 6\          | 7\          | 8\          | 9\          |

      |             | old yin     | young yang  | young yin   | old yang    |

      +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

      | Yarrow      | 1/16        | 5/16        | 7/16        | 3/16        |

      +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

      | Three coins | 2/16        | 6/16        | 6/16        | 2/16        |

      +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

      :::

      So both methods return equal probabilities for each hexagram since we

      have an equal chance (8/16) to have a yin or a yang sign, but the

      probabilities of the moving lines, the old yin and old yang are not the

      same using the yarrow stalks and the three coins.

      This is discussed in detail on the web page [The I Ching random

      numbers](https://aleadeum.com/2013/07/12/the-i-ching-random-numbers-and-why-you-are-doing-it-wrong/)

      where a number of comments can also be found.

      Do the differences matter or was it intended by the ancient Chinese, who

      developed the yarrow stalk method, to favour the old yang over the old

      yin?

      ### Alternate Method Using Two Coins

      An alternate method that provides the simplicity of the coins while

      preserving the probabilities of the yarrow stalks is to use two coins

      (using the same distinction as above where the inscribed side counts as

      yin and the reverse side counts as yang):

      1\. Take two coins and throw them once. If both coins come up as yin

      count this as 2, otherwise count it as 3.

      2\. Throw the coins again. This time each coin is counted as yin with a

      value of 2 or yang with value of 3.

      The resulting total will be 6, 7, 8 or 9.

      3\. Repeat both steps for each of the six lines of the hexagram.'
