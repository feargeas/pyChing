judgment: 'DURATION. Success. No blame.\

  Perseverance furthers.\

  It furthers one to have somewhere to go.


  Duration is a state whose movement is not worn down by hindrances. It is

  not a state of rest, for mere standstill is regression. Duration is

  rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an

  organized, firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with

  immutable laws and beginning anew at every ending. The end is reached by

  an inward movement, by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this

  movement turns into a new beginning, in which the movement is directed

  outward, in exhalation, diastole, expansion.


  Heavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in their fixed orbits, and

  because of this their light-giving power endures. The seasons of the

  year follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence can produce

  effects that endure.


  So likewise the dedicated man embodies an enduring meaning in his way of

  life, and thereby the world is formed. In that which gives things their

  duration, we can come to understand the nature of all beings in heaven

  and on earth.'
image: 'Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION.\

  Thus the superior man stands firm\

  And does not change has direction.


  Thunder rolls, and the wind blows; both are examples of extreme mobility

  and so are seemingly the very opposite of duration, but the laws

  governing their appearance and subsidence, their coming and going,

  endure. In the same way the independence of the superior man is not

  based on rigidity and immobility of character. He always keeps abreast

  of the time and changes with it. What endures is the unswerving

  directive, the inner law of his being, which determines all his actions.'

    text: 'Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.\

      Nothing that would further.

      Whatever endures can be created only gradually by long-continued work

      and careful reflection. In the same sense Lao-tse says: \"If we wish to

      compress something, we must first let it fully expand.\" He who demands

      too much at once is acting precipitately, and because he attempts too

      much, he ends by succeeding in nothing.'

    text: 'Remorse disappears.

      The situation is abnormal. A man\''s force of character is greater than

      the available material power. Thus he might be afraid of allowing

      himself to attempt something beyond his strength. However, since it is

      the time of DURATION, it is possible for him to control his inner

      strength and so to avoid excess. Cause for remorse then disappears.'

    text: 'He who does not give duration to his character\

      Meets with disgrace.\

      Persistent humiliation.

      If a man remains at the mercy of moods of hope or fear aroused by the

      outer world, he loses his inner consistency of character. Such

      inconsistency invariably leads to distressing experiences. These

      humiliations often come from an unforeseen quarter. Such experiences are

      not merely effects produced by the external world, but logical

      consequences evoked by his own nature.'

    text: 'No game in the field.

      If we are in pursuit of game and want to get a shot at a quarry, we must

      set about it in the right way. A man who persists in stalking game in a

      place where there is none may wait forever without finding any.

      Persistence in search is not enough. What is not sought in the right way

      is not found.'

    text: 'Giving duration to one\''s character through perseverance.\

      This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.

      A woman should follow a man her whole life long, but a man should at all

      times hold to what is his duty at the given moment. Should he

      persistently seek to conform to the woman, it would be a mistake for

      him. Accordingly it is altogether right for a woman to hold

      conservatively to tradition, but a man must always be flexible and

      adaptable and allow himself to be guided solely by what his duty

      requires of him at the moment.'

    text: 'Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune.

      There are people who live in a state of perpetual hurry without ever

      attaining inner composure. Restlessness not only prevents all

      thoroughness but actually becomes a danger if it is dominant in places

      of authority.'
