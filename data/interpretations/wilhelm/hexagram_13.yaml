judgment: 'FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.\

  Success.\

  It furthers one to cross the great water.\

  The perseverance of the superior man furthers.


  True fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is

  universal. It is not the private interests of the individual that create

  lasting fellowship among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is

  why it is said that fellowship with men in the open succeeds. If unity

  of this kind prevails, even difficult and dangerous tasks, such as

  crossing the great water, can be accomplished. But in order to bring

  about this sort of fellowship, a persevering and enlightened leader is

  needed --- a man with clear, convincing, and inspiring aims and the

  strength to carry them out. (The inner trigram means clarity; the outer,

  strength.)'
image: 'Heaven together with fire:\

  The image of FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN.\

  Thus the superior man organizes the clans\

  And makes distinctions between things.


  Heaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is different

  from fire. Just as the luminaries in the sky serve for the systematic

  division and arrangement of time, so human society and all things that

  really belong together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should

  not be a mere mingling of individuals or of things --- that would be

  chaos, not fellowship. If fellowship is to lead to order, there must be

  organization within diversity.'

    text: 'Fellowship with men at the gate.\

      No blame.

      The beginning of union among people should take place before the door.

      All are equally close to one another. No divergent aims have yet arisen,

      and one makes not mistakes. The basic principles of any kind of union

      must be equally accessible to all concerned. Secret agreements bring

      misfortune.'

    text: 'Fellowship with men in the clan.\

      Humiliation.

      There is danger here of formation of a separate faction on the basis of

      personal and egotistic interests. Such factions, which are exclusive

      and, instead of welcoming all men, must condemn one group in order to

      unite the others, originate from low motives and therefore lead in the

      course of time to humiliation.'

    text: 'He hides weapons in the thicket;\

      He climbs the high hill in front of it.\

      For three years he does not rise up.

      Here fellowship has changed about to mistrust. Each man distrusts the

      other, plans a secret ambush, and seeks to spy on his fellow form afar.

      We are dealing with an obstinate opponent whom we cannot come at by this

      method. Obstacles standing in the way of fellowship with others are

      shown here. One has mental reservations for one\''s own part and seeks to

      take his opponent by surprise. This very fact makes one mistrustful,

      suspecting the same wiles in his opponent and trying to ferret them out.

      The result is that one departs further and further from true fellowship.

      The longer this goes on, the more alienated one becomes.'

    text: 'He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.\

      Good fortune.

      Here the reconciliation that follows quarrel mover nearer. It is true

      that there are still dividing walls on which we stand confronting one

      another. But the difficulties are too great. We get into straits, and

      this brings us to our senses. We cannot fight, and therein lies our good

      fortune.'

    text: 'Men bound in fellowship first weep and lament,\

      But afterward they laugh.\

      After great struggles they succeed in meeting.

      Two people are outwardly separated, but in their hearts they are united.

      They are kept apart by their positions in life. Many difficulties and

      obstructions arise between them and cause them grief. But, remaining

      true to each other, the allow nothing to separate them, and although it

      costs them a severe struggle to overcome the obstacles, they will

      succeed. When they come together their sadness will change to joy.

      Confucius says of this:

      Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings. Now the course

      is checked, now it runs straight again. Here winged thoughts may pour

      freely forth in words, There the heavy burden of knowledge must be shut

      away in silence. But when two people are at one in the inmost hearts,

      They shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze. And when two people

      understand each other in their inmost hearts, Their words are sweet and

      strong, like the fragrance of orchids.'

    text: 'Fellowship with men in the meadow.\

      No remorse.

      The warm attachment that springs from the heart is lacking here. We are

      by this time actually outside of fellowship with others. However, we

      ally ourselves with them. The fellowship does not include all, but only

      those who happen to dwell near one another. The meadow is the pasture at

      the entrance to the town. At this stage, the ultimate goal of the union

      of mankind has not yet been attained, but we need not reproach

      ourselves. We join the community without separate aims of our own.'
