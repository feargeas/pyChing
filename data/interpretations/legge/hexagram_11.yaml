    text: shows that, while there is no state of peace that is not liable to be disturbed,
      and no departure of evil people so that they shall not return, yet when one
      is firm and correct, as one realises the distresses that may arise, one will
      commit no error. There is no occasion for sadness at the certainty of such recurring
      changes; and in this mood the happiness of the present may be long enjoyed.
  '4':
    position: fourth
    type: six
    text: shows its subject fluttering down; not relying on their own rich resources,

    text: shows us the city wall returned into the moat. It is not the time to use
      the army. The subject of the line may, indeed, announce their orders to the
      people of their own city; but however correct and firm they may be, they will
      have cause for regret.
