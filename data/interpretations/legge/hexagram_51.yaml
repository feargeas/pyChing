title: 51. Tchen / The Thunder
trigrams:
  upper: zhen
  lower: zhen
judgment: Tchen gives the intimation of ease and development. When the time of movement
  which it indicates comes, the subject of the hexagram will be found looking out
  with apprehension, and yet smiling and talking cheerfully. When the movement like
  a crash of thunder terrifies all within a hundred miles, they will be like the sincere
  worshipper who is not startled into letting go their ladle and cup of sacrificial
  spirits.
image: The trigram representing thunder, being repeated, forms Tchen. The superior
  person, in accordance with this, is fearful and apprehensive, cultivates their virtues,
  and examines their faults.
lines:
  '1':
    position: bottom
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject, when the movement approaches, looking out and around
      with apprehension, and afterwards smiling and talking cheerfully. There will
      be good fortune.
  '2':
    position: second
    type: six
    text: shows its subject, when the movement approaches, in a position of peril.
      They judge it better to let go the articles in their possession, and to ascend
      a very lofty height. There is no occasion for them to pursue after the things
      they have let go; in seven days they will find them.
  '3':
    position: third
    type: six
    text: shows its subject distraught amid the startling movements going on. If those
      movements excite them to right action, there will be no mistake.
  '4':
    position: fourth
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject amid the startling movements, supinely sinking deeper
      in the mud.
  '5':
    position: fifth
    type: six
    text: shows its subject going and coming amidst the startling movements of the
      time, and always in peril, but perhaps they will not incur loss, and find business
      which they can accomplish.
  '6':
    position: topmost
    type: six
    text: shows its subject, amidst the startling movements of the time, in breathless
      dismay and looking round them with trembling apprehension. If they take action,
      there will be evil. If, while the startling movements have not reached their
      own person and their neighbourhood, they were to take precautions, there would
      be no error, but their relatives might still speak against them.
