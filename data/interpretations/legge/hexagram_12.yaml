title: 12. P'i / Stagnation, Obstruction
trigrams:
  upper: qian
  lower: kun
judgment: In P'i there is the want of good understanding between people at different
  levels of development, and its indication is unfavourable to the firm and correct
  course of the superior person. We see in it the great gone and the small comming.
image: The trigrams of heaven and earth, not in intercommunication, form P'i. The
  superior person, in accordance with this, restrains the manifestation of their virtue,
  and avoids the calamities that threaten them. There is no opportunity of conferring
  on them the glory of reward in their employment.
