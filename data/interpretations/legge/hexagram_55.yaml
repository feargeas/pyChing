lines:
  '1':
    position: bottom
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject meeting with their mate. Though they are both of the same
      character, there will be no error. Advance will call forth approval.
  '2':
    position: second
    type: six
    text: shows its subject surrounded by screens so large and thick that at midday
      they can see from them the constellation of the Bushel. If they go and try to
      enlighten their ruler who is thus emblemed, they will make themselves to be
      viewed with suspicion and dislike. Let them cherish their feeling of sincere
      devotion that they may thereby move their ruler's mind, and there will be good
      fortune.
  '3':
    position: third
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject with an additional screen of a large and thick banner,
      through which at midday they can see the small Mei star. In the darkness they
      break their right arm; but there will be no error.
  '4':
    position: fourth
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject in a tent so large and thick that at midday they can see
      from it the constellation of the Bushel. But they meet with the subject of the
      first line, as nine like themselves. There will be good fortune.
  '5':
    position: fifth
    type: six
    text: shows its subject bringing around them people of brilliant ability. There
      will be occasion for congratulation and praise. There will be good fortune.
  '6':
    position: topmost
    type: six
    text: shows its subject with their house made large, but only serving as a screen
      to their household. When they look at their door, it is still, and there is
      nobody about it. For three years no one is to be seen. There will be evil.
