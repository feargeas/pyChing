title: 3. T'oun / Difficult Beginnings
trigrams:
  upper: kan
  lower: zhen
judgment: T'oun indicates that there can be great progress and success, and the advantage
  will come from being correct and firm. But any movement in advance should not be
  lightly undertaken. There will be advantage in appointing feudal princes.
image: The trigram representing clouds and that representing thunder form T'oun. The
  superior person, in accordance with this, adjusts their measures of government as
  in sorting the threads of the warp and weft.
lines:
  '1':
    position: bottom
    type: nine
    text: shows the difficulty its subject has in advancing. It will be advantageous
      for them to abide in the correct and firm; advantageous also to be made a feudal
      ruler.
  '2':
    position: second
    type: six
    text: shows its subject distressed and obliged to return; even the horses of her
      chariot also seem to be retreating. But not by a despoiler is she assailed,
      rather by one who seeks her to be her wife. The young lady maintains her firm
      correctness, and declines a union. After ten years she will be united, and have
      children.
  '3':
    position: third
    type: six
    text: shows one following the deer without the guidance of the forester, and only
      finding themselves in the midst of the forest. The superior person, acquainted
      with the secret risk, thinks it better to give up the chase. If they went forward,
      they would regret it.
  '4':
    position: fourth
    type: six
    text: shows a lady, the horses of whose chariot appear to be in retreat. She seeks,
      however, the help of those who seek her to be their wife. Advance will be fortunate,
      all will turn out advantageously.
  '5':
    position: fifth
    type: nine
    text: shows the difficulties in the way of the subject's dispensing the rich favours
      that might be expected from them. With firmness and correctness there will be
      good fortune in small things; but even with them, in great things there will
      be evil.
  '6':
    position: topmost
    type: six
    text: shows its subject with the horses of their chariot obliged to retreat, and
      weeping tears of blood in streams.
