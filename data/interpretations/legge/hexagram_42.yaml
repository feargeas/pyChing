    text: shows increase given to its subject by means of what is evil, so that they
      shall be led to good, and be without blame. Let them be sincere and pursue the

      officer who announces themselves to their prince by the symbol of their rank.

    text: shows its subject with sincere heart seeking to benefit all below. There
      need be no question about it; the result will be great good fortune. All below

    type: nine
    text: we see one to whose increase none will contribute, while persons will seek
      to assail them. They observe no regular rule in the ordering of their heart.
      There will be evil.
