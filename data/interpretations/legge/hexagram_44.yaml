lines:
  '1':
    position: bottom
    type: six
    text: shows how its subject should be kept like a carriage tied and fastened to
      a metal drag, in which case with firm correctness there will be good fortune.
      But if they move in any direction, evil will appear. They will be like a lean
      pig, which is sure to keep jumping about.
  '2':
    position: second
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject with a wallet of fish. There will be no error. But it
      will not be well to let the subject of the first line go forward to the guests.
  '3':
    position: third
    type: nine
    text: shows one from whose buttocks the skin has been stripped so that they walk
      with difficulty. The position is perilous, but there will be no great error.
  '4':
    position: fourth
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject with their fish wallet, but no fish in it. This will give
      rise to evil.
  '5':
    position: fifth
    type: nine
    text: shows a medlar tree overspreading the gourd beneath it. If they keep their
      brilliant qualities concealed, a good issue will descend as from Heaven.
  '6':
    position: topmost
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject receiving others on their horns. There will be occasion
      for regret, but there will be no error.
