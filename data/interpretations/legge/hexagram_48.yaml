title: 48. Tsing / A Well
trigrams:
  upper: kan
  lower: xun
judgment: Looking at Tsing, we think of how the site of a town may be changed, while
  the fashion of its wells undergoes no changes. The water of a well never disappears
  and never receives any great increase, and those who come and those who go can draw
  and enjoy the benefit. If the drawing has nearly been accomplished, but, before
  the rope has quite reached the water, the bucket is broken, this is evil.
image: The trigram representing wood, and above it that for water, form Tsing. The
  superior person, in accordance with this, comforts the people, and stimulates them
  to mutual helpfulness.
lines:
  '1':
    position: bottom
    type: six
    text: shows a well so muddy that people will not drink of it; or an old well to
      which neither birds nor other creatures resort.
  '2':
    position: second
    type: nine
    text: shows a well from which by a hole the water escapes and flows away to the
      shrimps and such small creatures among the grass, or one the water of which
      leaks away as from a broken basket.
  '3':
    position: third
    type: nine
    text: shows a well, which has been cleared out, but is not used. Our hearts are
      sorry for this, for the water might be drawn out and used. If the king were
      only intelligent, both they and we might receive the benefit of it.
  '4':
    position: fourth
    type: six
    text: shows a well, the lining of which is well laid. There will be no error.
  '5':
    position: fifth
    type: nine
    text: shows a clear, limpid well, the waters from whose cold spring are freely
      drunk.
  '6':
    position: topmost
    type: six
    text: shows the water from the well brought to the top, which is not allowed to
      be covered. This suggests the idea of sincerity. There will be great good fortune.
