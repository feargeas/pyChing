    type: nine
    text: shows its subject like the crane crying out in her hidden retirement, and
      her young ones responding to her. It is as if it were said, 'I have a cup of
      good spirits', and the response were, 'I will partake of it with you.'
  '3':

    text: shows its subject like the moon nearly full, and like a horse in a chariot
      whose fellow disappears. There will be no error.

      union. There will be no error.

      correctness there will be evil.
