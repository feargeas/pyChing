title: 6. Song / The Conflict
trigrams:
  upper: qian
  lower: kan
judgment: Song intimates how, though there is sincerity in one's contention, they
  will meet with opposition and obstruction; but if they cherish an apprehensive caution,
  there will be good fortune, while, if they must prosecute the contention to the
  bitter end, there will be evil. It will be advantageous to see the great person;
  it will not be advantageous to cross the great stream.
image: The trigram representing heaven and that representing water, moving away from
  each other, form Song. The superior person, in accordance with this, in the transaction
  of affairs takes good counsel about their first steps.
lines:
  '1':
    position: bottom

      He will suffer the small injury of being spoken against, but the end will be
      fortunate.
  '2':
    position: second
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject keeping peace with three hundred families, and therefore
      falling into no mistake.
  '3':

    type: six
    text: shows its subject staying in the old place assigned for their support, and
      being firmly correct. Perilous as the position is, there will be good fortune

      claim the merit of achievement.
  '4':
    position: fourth
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject unequal to the contention. They return to the study of
      Heaven's ordinances, change their wish to contend and rest in being firm and
      correct. There will be good fortune.
  '5':
    position: fifth
    type: nine
    text: shows its subject contending; and with great good fortune.

    position: topmost
    type: nine

      sovereign, and thrice it shall be taken from them in a morning.
