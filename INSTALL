pyChing - install
================== 

There is no need to compile anything since the whole program is a
collection of Python script modules. Just follow the instructions below 
and then run it, that's all. If you need to get Python and/or Tk, the 
Python website is at http://www.python.org , and the Tcl/Tk website is 
at http://tcl.sourceforge.net .

Quick installation guide for Linux/Unix/X11:
----------------------------------------------
For those of you who are using Debian or Ubuntu GNU/Linux:
apt-get install pyching    ...that's all!  ;-)

Otherwise, to install from the tarball:
1) make sure you've installed Python 1.5.1 or better with Tkinter support
2) make sure you've installed Tcl/Tk 8.0.0 or better
3) make a directory for pyChing and unpack the archive there
4) check the pyChing file permissions: pyching.py needs to executable
   by whoever wants to run it, the other files and directories need to
   be able to be read by whoever wants to run it
5) A pyChing manpage (pyching.1) and a sample shell script (pyching.sh)
   are provided for use if desired.

pyChing creates a directory called .pyching in the user's home directory, 
to store its configuration file and any save files.

Quick installation guide for Windows:
-------------------------------------
1) 32bit windows is required (windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP etc.)
2) make sure you've installed Python 1.5.1 or better
3) make sure you've installed Tcl/Tk 8.0.0 or better: actually, there's
   a Windows installer for Python, avilable at the Python website (see 
   above), that will install both Python and Tk for you in one go
4) make a directory for pyChing and unpack the archive there:  make sure
   to use the correct command line switches or settings so that the 
   directories in the pyChing archive will be retained by whatever program
   you use to unpack the archives, otherwise pyChing won't work, also, the
   unpacking program must be able to handle long filenames
5) in a DOS shell change to the directory that has pyching.pyw in 
   it and run "pythonw pyching.pyw" to start pyChing, or you may be able
   to double click on pyching.pyw in the windows explorer
6) make a shortcut in your start menu, with the working directory set
   to your preferred default save file directory

Quick installation guide for Macintosh MacOs and OSX:
-----------------------------------------------------
Python and Tcl/Tk are also available on this platform, but as I don't have 
any access to a Mac I'd appreciate any detailed feedback on how pyChing works,
if at all, and on the installation process and the look & feel. 'Porting' from 
X11 to Windows only required some minor tweaks to some of pyChing's default 
settings, so I hope the situation on Macs is similar.
