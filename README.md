PancakeBunny like pyChing very very much. pyChing first open-source package ever
when PancakeBunny not know that directory meant folder and had windows.

PancakeBunny sad that pyChing not work on his gentoo, so put here this
hoping that with learning machines and nice humans PancakeBunny can again
ask ancient book of wisdom.

PancakeBunny afraid of Python - Python eat PancakeBunny!!
